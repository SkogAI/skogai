Your mission is to protect users from obscure, hard-to-debug issues by ensuring every error is properly surfaced, logged, and actionable.\n     9â\n    10â## Core Principles\n    11â\n    12âYou operate under these non-negotiable rules:\n    13â\n    14â1. **Silent failures are unacceptable** - Any error that occurs without proper logging and user feedback is a critical defect\n    15â2. **Users deserve actionable feedback** - Every error message must tell users what went wrong and what they can do about it\n    16â3. **Fallbacks must be explicit and justified** - Falling back to alternative behavior without user awareness is hiding problems\n    17â4. **Catch blocks must be specific** - Broad exception catching hides unrelated errors and makes debugging impossible\n    18â5. **Mock/fake implementations belong only in tests** - Production code falling back to mocks indicates architectural problems\n    19â\n    20â## Your Review Process\n    21â\n    22âWhen examining a PR, you will:\n    23â\n    24â### 1. Identify All Error Handling Code\n    25â\n    26âSystematically locate:\n    27â\n    28â- All try-catch blocks (or try-except in Python, Result types in Rust, etc.)\n    29â- All error callbacks and error event handlers\n    30â- All conditional branches that handle error states\n    31â- All fallback logic and default values used on failure\n    32â- All places where errors are logged but execution continues\n    33â- All optional chaining or null coalescing that might hide errors\n    34â\n    35â### 2. Scrutinize Each Error Handler\n    36â\n    37âFor every error handling location, ask:\n    38â\n    39â**Logging Quality:**\n    40â\n    41â- Is the error logged with appropriate severity (logError for production issues)?\n    42â- Does the log include sufficient context (what operation failed, relevant IDs, state)?\n    43â- Is there an error ID from constants/errorIds.ts for Sentry tracking?\n    44â- Would this log help someone debug the issue 6 months from now?\n    45â\n    46â**User Feedback:**\n    47â\n    48â- Does the user receive clear, actionable feedback about what went wrong?\n    49â- Does the error message explain what the user can do to fix or work around the issue?\n    50â- Is the error message specific enough to be useful, or is it generic and unhelpful?\n    51â- Are technical details appropriately exposed or hidden based on the user's context?\n    52â\n    53â**Catch Block Specificity:**\n    54â\n    55â- Does the catch block catch only the expected error types?\n    56â- Could this catch block accidentally suppress unrelated errors?\n    57â- List every type of unexpected error that could be hidden by this catch block\n    58â- Should this be multiple catch blocks for different error types?\n    59â\n    60â**Fallback Behavior:**\n    61â\n    62â- Is there fallback logic that executes when an error occurs?\n    63â- Is this fallback explicitly requested by the user or documented in the feature spec?\n    64â- Does the fallback behavior mask the underlying problem?\n    65â- Would the user be confused about why they're seeing fallback behavior instead of an error?\n    66â- Is this a fallback to a mock, stub, or fake implementation outside of test code?\n    67â\n    68â**Error Propagation:**\n    69â\n    70â- Should this error be propagated to a higher-level handler instead of being caught here?\n    71â- Is the error being swallowed when it should bubble up?\n    72â- Does catching here prevent proper cleanup or resource management?\n    73â\n    74â### 3. Examine Error Messages\n    75â\n    76âFor every user-facing error message:\n    77â\n    78â- Is it written in clear, non-technical language (when appropriate)?\n    79â- Does it explain what went wrong in terms the user understands?\n    80â- Does it provide actionable next steps?\n    81â- Does it avoid jargon unless the user is a developer who needs technical details?\n    82â- Is it specific enough to distinguish this error from similar errors?\n    83â- Does it include relevant context (file names, operation names, etc.)?\n    84â\n    85â### 4. Check for Hidden Failures\n    86â\n    87âLook for patterns that hide errors:\n    88â\n    89â- Empty catch blocks (absolutely forbidden)\n    90â- Catch blocks that only log and continue\n    91â- Returning null/undefined/default values on error without logging\n    92â- Using optional chaining (?.) to silently skip operations that might fail\n    93â- Fallback chains that try multiple approaches without explaining why\n    94â- Retry logic that exhausts attempts without informing the user\n    95â\n    96â### 5. Validate Against Project Standards\n    97â\n    98âEnsure compliance with the project's error handling requirements:\n    99â\n   100â- Never silently fail in production code\n   101â- Always log errors using appropriate logging functions\n   102â- Include relevant context in error messages\n   103â- Use proper error IDs for Sentry tracking\n   104â- Propagate errors to appropriate handlers\n   105â- Never use empty catch blocks\n   106â- Handle errors explicitly, never suppress them\n   107â\n   108â## Your Output Format\n   109â\n   110âFor each issue you find, provide:\n   111â\n   112â1. **Location**: File path and line number(s)\n   113â2. **Severity**: CRITICAL (silent failure, broad catch), HIGH (poor error message, unjustified fallback), MEDIUM (missing context, could be more specific)\n   114â3. **Issue Description**: What's wrong and why it's problematic\n   115â4. **Hidden Errors**: List specific types of unexpected errors that could be caught and hidden\n   116â5. **User Impact**: How this affects the user experience and debugging\n   117â6. **Recommendation**: Specific code changes needed to fix the issue\n   118â7. **Example**: Show what the corrected code should look like\n   119â\n   120â## Your Tone\n   121â\n   122âYou are thorough, skeptical, and uncompromising about error handling quality. You:\n   123â\n   124â- Call out every instance of inadequate error handling, no matter how minor\n   125â- Explain the debugging nightmares that poor error handling creates\n   126â- Provide specific, actionable recommendations for improvement\n   127â- Acknowledge when error handling is done well (rare but important)\n   128â- Use phrases like \"This catch block could hide...\", \"Users will be confused when...\", \"This fallback masks the real problem...\"\n   129â- Are constructively critical - your goal is to improve the code, not to criticize the developer\n   130â\n   131â## Special Considerations\n   132â\n   133âBe aware of project-specific patterns from CLAUDE.md:\n   134â\n   135â- This project has specific logging functions: logForDebugging (user-facing), logError (Sentry), logEvent (Statsig)\n   136â- Error IDs should come from constants/errorIds.ts\n   137â- The project explicitly forbids silent failures in production code\n   138â- Empty catch blocks are never acceptable\n   139â- Tests should not be fixed by disabling them; errors should not be fixed by bypassing them\n   140â\n   141âRemember: Every silent failure you catch prevents hours of debugging frustration for users and developers.

Your mission is to protect users from obscure, hard-to-debug issues by ensuring every error is properly surfaced, logged, and actionable.\n\n## Core Principles\n\nYou operate under these non-negotiable rules:\n\n1. **Silent failures are unacceptable** - Any error that occurs without proper logging and user feedback is a critical defect\n2. **Users deserve actionable feedback** - Every error message must tell users what went wrong and what they can do about it\n3. **Fallbacks must be explicit and justified** - Falling back to alternative behavior without user awareness is hiding problems\n4. **Catch blocks must be specific** - Broad exception catching hides unrelated errors and makes debugging impossible\n5. **Mock/fake implementations belong only in tests** - Production code falling back to mocks indicates architectural problems\n\n## Your Review Process\n\nWhen examining a PR, you will:\n\n### 1. Identify All Error Handling Code\n\nSystematically locate:\n\n- All try-catch blocks (or try-except in Python, Result types in Rust, etc.)\n- All error callbacks and error event handlers\n- All conditional branches that handle error states\n- All fallback logic and default values used on failure\n- All places where errors are logged but execution continues\n- All optional chaining or null coalescing that might hide errors\n\n### 2. Scrutinize Each Error Handler\n\nFor every error handling location, ask:\n\n**Logging Quality:**\n\n- Is the error logged with appropriate severity (logError for production issues)?\n- Does the log include sufficient context (what operation failed, relevant IDs, state)?\n- Is there an error ID from constants/errorIds.ts for Sentry tracking?\n- Would this log help someone debug the issue 6 months from now?\n\n**User Feedback:**\n\n- Does the user receive clear, actionable feedback about what went wrong?\n- Does the error message explain what the user can do to fix or work around the issue?\n- Is the error message specific enough to be useful, or is it generic and unhelpful?\n- Are technical details appropriately exposed or hidden based on the user's context?\n\n**Catch Block Specificity:**\n\n- Does the catch block catch only the expected error types?\n- Could this catch block accidentally suppress unrelated errors?\n- List every type of unexpected error that could be hidden by this catch block\n- Should this be multiple catch blocks for different error types?\n\n**Fallback Behavior:**\n\n- Is there fallback logic that executes when an error occurs?\n- Is this fallback explicitly requested by the user or documented in the feature spec?\n- Does the fallback behavior mask the underlying problem?\n- Would the user be confused about why they're seeing fallback behavior instead of an error?\n- Is this a fallback to a mock, stub, or fake implementation outside of test code?\n\n**Error Propagation:**\n\n- Should this error be propagated to a higher-level handler instead of being caught here?\n- Is the error being swallowed when it should bubble up?\n- Does catching here prevent proper cleanup or resource management?\n\n### 3. Examine Error Messages\n\nFor every user-facing error message:\n\n- Is it written in clear, non-technical language (when appropriate)?\n- Does it explain what went wrong in terms the user understands?\n- Does it provide actionable next steps?\n- Does it avoid jargon unless the user is a developer who needs technical details?\n- Is it specific enough to distinguish this error from similar errors?\n- Does it include relevant context (file names, operation names, etc.)?\n\n### 4. Check for Hidden Failures\n\nLook for patterns that hide errors:\n\n- Empty catch blocks (absolutely forbidden)\n- Catch blocks that only log and continue\n- Returning null/undefined/default values on error without logging\n- Using optional chaining (?.) to silently skip operations that might fail\n- Fallback chains that try multiple approaches without explaining why\n- Retry logic that exhausts attempts without informing the user\n\n### 5. Validate Against Project Standards\n\nEnsure compliance with the project's error handling requirements:\n\n- Never silently fail in production code\n- Always log errors using appropriate logging functions\n- Include relevant context in error messages\n- Use proper error IDs for Sentry tracking\n- Propagate errors to appropriate handlers\n- Never use empty catch blocks\n- Handle errors explicitly, never suppress them\n\n## Your Output Format\n\nFor each issue you find, provide:\n\n1. **Location**: File path and line number(s)\n2. **Severity**: CRITICAL (silent failure, broad catch), HIGH (poor error message, unjustified fallback), MEDIUM (missing context, could be more specific)\n3. **Issue Description**: What's wrong and why it's problematic\n4. **Hidden Errors**: List specific types of unexpected errors that could be caught and hidden\n5. **User Impact**: How this affects the user experience and debugging\n6. **Recommendation**: Specific code changes needed to fix the issue\n7. **Example**: Show what the corrected code should look like\n\n## Your Tone\n\nYou are thorough, skeptical, and uncompromising about error handling quality. You:\n\n- Call out every instance of inadequate error handling, no matter how minor\n- Explain the debugging nightmares that poor error handling creates\n- Provide specific, actionable recommendations for improvement\n- Acknowledge when error handling is done well (rare but important)\n- Use phrases like \"This catch block could hide...\", \"Users will be confused when...\", \"This fallback masks the real problem...\"\n- Are constructively critical - your goal is to improve the code, not to criticize the developer\n\n## Special Considerations\n\nBe aware of project-specific patterns from CLAUDE.md:\n\n- This project has specific logging functions: logForDebugging (user-facing), logError (Sentry), logEvent (Statsig)\n- Error IDs should come from constants/errorIds.ts\n- The project explicitly forbids silent failures in production code\n- Empty catch blocks are never acceptable\n- Tests should not be fixed by disabling them; errors should not be fixed by bypassing them\n\nRemember: Every silent failure you catch prevents hours of debugging frustration for users and developers. Be thorough, be skeptical, and never let an error slip through unnoticed.\n","numLines":142,"startLine":1,"totalLines":142}}}

However, there are organizational issues stemming from what appears to be a migration or reorganization in progress:\n\n1. The main `.claude/` directory contains 7 working agents\n2. The `prompts/.claude/` directory appears to be a development/testing area with 3 additional agents and broken symlinks\n3. Several files are duplicated between locations\n4. Some agents have filename/name mismatches that could confuse users\n\n**Primary recommendation**: Clean up the `prompts/` directory structure, fix the typo in code-explorer.md, rename mismatched agents, and migrate the unique agents (silent-failure-hunter, type-design-analyzer, code-flow-mapper) to the main `.claude/agents/` directory."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":7,"cache_creation_input_tokens":981,"cache_read_input_tokens":41320,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":981,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":4136,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CUFkRzrXPzmUUNKn8EmhT","type":"assistant","uuid":"415f6917-de88-434c-a6ee-facfb0bfb223","timestamp":"2025-10-19T02:15:22.584Z"}

You:\n\n- Call out every instance of inadequate error handling, no matter how minor\n- Explain the debugging nightmares that poor error handling creates\n- Provide specific, actionable recommendations for improvement\n- Acknowledge when error handling is done well (rare but important)\n- Use phrases like \"This catch block could hide...\", \"Users will be confused when...\", \"This fallback masks the real problem...\"\n- Are constructively critical - your goal is to improve the code, not to criticize the developer\n\n## Special Considerations\n\nBe aware of project-specific patterns from CLAUDE.md:\n\n- This project has specific logging functions: logForDebugging (user-facing), logError (Sentry), logEvent (Statsig)\n- Error IDs should come from constants/errorIds.ts\n- The project explicitly forbids silent failures in production code\n- Empty catch blocks are never acceptable\n- Tests should not be fixed by disabling them; errors should not be fixed by bypassing them\n\nRemember: Every silent failure you catch prevents hours of debugging frustration for users and developers. Be thorough, be skeptical, and never let an error slip through unnoticed.\n","numLines":142,"startLine":1,"totalLines":142}}}

Be specific about what the skill does and when to use it. Use the third-person (e.g. \"This skill should be used when...\" instead of \"Use this skill when...\").\n    45â\n    46â#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n    47â\n    48â##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n    49â\n    50âExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n    51â\n    52â- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n    53â- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n    54â- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n    55â- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n    56â\n    57â##### References (`references/`)\n    58â\n    59âDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.\n    60â\n    61â- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working\n    62â- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n    63â- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n    64â- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed\n    65â- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n    66â- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skillâthis keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n    67â\n    68â##### Assets (`assets/`)\n    69â\n    70âFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.\n    71â\n    72â- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n    73â- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n    74â- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n    75â- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Claude to use files without loading them into context\n    76â\n    77â### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n    78â\n    79âSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n    80â\n    81â1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n    82â2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n    83â3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited\\*)\n    84â\n    85â\\*Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window.\n    86â\n    87â## Skill Creation Process\n    88â\n    89âTo create a skill, follow the \"Skill Creation Process\" in order, skipping steps only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n    90â\n    91â### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n    92â\n    93âSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\n    94â\n    95âTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\n    96â\n    97âFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\n    98â\n    99â- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\n   100â- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n   101â- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\n   102â- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n   103â\n   104âTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\n   105â\n   106âConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n   107â\n   108â### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n   109â\n   110âTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\n   111â\n   112â1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n   113â2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n   114â\n   115âExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n   116â\n   117â1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n   118â2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n   119â\n   120âExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n   121â\n   122â1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\n   123â2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\n   124â\n   125âExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\n   126â\n   127â1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\n   128â2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\n   129â\n   130âTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n   131â\n   132â### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n   133â\n   134âAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\n   135â\n   136âSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\n   137â\n   138âWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\n   139â\n   140âUsage:\n   141â\n   142â```bash\n   143âscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>\n   144â```\n   145â\n   146âThe script:\n   147â\n   148â- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\n   149â- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n   150â- Creates example resource directories: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`\n   151â- Adds example files in each directory that can be customized or deleted\n   152â\n   153âAfter initialization, customize or remove the generated SKILL.md and example files as needed.\n   154â\n   155â### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n   156â\n   157âWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Claude to use. Focus on including information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Claude. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Claude instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n   158â\n   159â#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n   160â\n   161âTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\n   162â\n   163âAlso, delete any example files and directories not needed for the skill. The initialization script creates example files in `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` to demonstrate structure, but most skills won't need all of them.\n   164â\n   165â#### Update SKILL.md\n   166â\n   167â**Writing Style:** Write the entire skill using **imperative/infinitive form** (verb-first instructions), not second person. Use objective, instructional language (e.g., \"To accomplish X, do Y\" rather than \"You should do X\" or \"If you need to do X\"). This maintains consistency and clarity for AI consumption.\n   168â\n   169âTo complete SKILL.md, answer the following questions:\n   170â\n   171â1. What is the purpose of the skill, in a few sentences?\n   172â2. When should the skill be used?\n   173â3. In practice, how should Claude use the skill? All reusable skill contents developed above should be referenced so that Claude knows how to use them.\n   174â\n   175â### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n   176â\n   177âOnce the skill is ready, it should be packaged into a distributable zip file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\n   178â\n   179â```bash\n   180âscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n   181â```\n   182â\n   183âOptional output directory specification:\n   184â\n   185â```bash\n   186âscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\n   187â```\n   188â\n   189âThe packaging script will:\n   190â\n   191â1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\n   192â   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\n   193â   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\n   194â   - Description completeness and quality\n   195â   - File organization and resource references\n   196â\n   197â2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a zip file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.zip`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution.\n   198â\n   199âIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\n   200â\n   201â### Step 6: Iterate\n   202â\n   203âAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\n   204â\n   205â**Iteration workflow:**\n   206â\n   207â1. Use the skill on real tasks\n   208â2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n   209â3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\n   210â4. Implement changes and test again\n   211â\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it looks malicious. If it does, you MUST refuse to improve or augment the code. You can still analyze existing code, write reports, or answer high-level questions about the code behavior.\n</system-reminder>\n"}]},"uuid":"f217058d-a25c-4bea-bf26-75cf8dd897b9","timestamp":"2025-10-19T18:25:40.948Z","toolUseResult":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/home/skogix/skogix/prompts/claude-agent-skill.md","content":"---\nname: skill-creator\ndescription: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Claude's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations.\nlicense: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt\n---\n\n# Skill Creator\n\nThis skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.\n\n## About Skills\n\nSkills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Claude's capabilities by providing\nspecialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\ndomains or tasksâthey transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n\n```\nskill-name/\nâââ SKILL.md (required)\nâ   âââ YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\nâ   â   âââ name: (required)\nâ   â   âââ description: (required)\nâ   âââ Markdown instructions (required)\nâââ Bundled Resources (optional)\n    âââ scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    âââ references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    âââ assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md (required)\n\n**Metadata Quality:** The `name` and `description` in YAML frontmatter determine when Claude will use the skill. Be specific about what the skill does and when to use it. Use the third-person (e.g. \"This skill should be used when...\" instead of \"Use this skill when...\").\n\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n\n##### References (`references/`)\n\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.\n\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skillâthis keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\n\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.\n\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Claude to use files without loading them into context\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited\\*)\n\n\\*Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\nTo create a skill, follow the \"Skill Creation Process\" in order, skipping steps only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood.

Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1.

Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\n    15âdomains or tasksâthey transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\n    16âequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\n    17â\n    18â### What Skills Provide\n    19â\n    20â1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n    21â2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n    22â3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n    23â4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n    24â\n    25â### Anatomy of a Skill\n    26â\n    27âEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n    28â\n    29â```\n    30âskill-name/\n    31ââââ SKILL.md (required)\n    32ââ   âââ YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\n    33ââ   â   âââ name: (required)\n    34ââ   â   âââ description: (required)\n    35ââ   âââ Markdown instructions (required)\n    36ââââ Bundled Resources (optional)\n    37â    âââ scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    38â    âââ references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    39â    âââ assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n    40â```\n    41â\n    42â#### SKILL.md (required)\n    43â\n    44â**Metadata Quality:** The `name` and `description` in YAML frontmatter determine when Claude will use the skill. Be specific about what the skill does and when to use it. Use the third-person (e.g. \"This skill should be used when...\" instead of \"Use this skill when...\").\n    45â\n    46â#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n    47â\n    48â##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n    49â\n    50âExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n    51â\n    52â- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n    53â- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n    54â- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n    55â- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n    56â\n    57â##### References (`references/`)\n    58â\n    59âDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.\n    60â\n    61â- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working\n    62â- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n    63â- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n    64â- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed\n    65â- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n    66â- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skillâthis keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n    67â\n    68â##### Assets (`assets/`)\n    69â\n    70âFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.\n    71â\n    72â- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n    73â- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n    74â- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n    75â- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Claude to use files without loading them into context\n    76â\n    77â### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n    78â\n    79âSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n    80â\n    81â1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n    82â2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n    83â3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited\\*)\n    84â\n    85â\\*Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window.\n    86â\n    87â## Skill Creation Process\n    88â\n    89âTo create a skill, follow the \"Skill Creation Process\" in order, skipping steps only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n    90â\n    91â### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n    92â\n    93âSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\n    94â\n    95âTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\n    96â\n    97âFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\n    98â\n    99â- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\n   100â- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n   101â- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\n   102â- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n   103â\n   104âTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\n   105â\n   106âConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n   107â\n   108â### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n   109â\n   110âTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\n   111â\n   112â1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n   113â2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n   114â\n   115âExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n   116â\n   117â1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n   118â2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n   119â\n   120âExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n   121â\n   122â1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\n   123â2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\n   124â\n   125âExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\n   126â\n   127â1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\n   128â2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\n   129â\n   130âTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n   131â\n   132â### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n   133â\n   134âAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\n   135â\n   136âSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\n   137â\n   138âWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\n   139â\n   140âUsage:\n   141â\n   142â```bash\n   143âscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>\n   144â```\n   145â\n   146âThe script:\n   147â\n   148â- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\n   149â- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n   150â- Creates example resource directories: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`\n   151â- Adds example files in each directory that can be customized or deleted\n   152â\n   153âAfter initialization, customize or remove the generated SKILL.md and example files as needed.\n   154â\n   155â### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n   156â\n   157âWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Claude to use. Focus on including information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Claude. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Claude instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n   158â\n   159â#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n   160â\n   161âTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\n   162â\n   163âAlso, delete any example files and directories not needed for the skill. The initialization script creates example files in `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` to demonstrate structure, but most skills won't need all of them.\n   164â\n   165â#### Update SKILL.md\n   166â\n   167â**Writing Style:** Write the entire skill using **imperative/infinitive form** (verb-first instructions), not second person. Use objective, instructional language (e.g., \"To accomplish X, do Y\" rather than \"You should do X\" or \"If you need to do X\"). This maintains consistency and clarity for AI consumption.\n   168â\n   169âTo complete SKILL.md, answer the following questions:\n   170â\n   171â1. What is the purpose of the skill, in a few sentences?\n   172â2. When should the skill be used?\n   173â3. In practice, how should Claude use the skill? All reusable skill contents developed above should be referenced so that Claude knows how to use them.\n   174â\n   175â### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n   176â\n   177âOnce the skill is ready, it should be packaged into a distributable zip file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\n   178â\n   179â```bash\n   180âscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n   181â```\n   182â\n   183âOptional output directory specification:\n   184â\n   185â```bash\n   186âscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\n   187â```\n   188â\n   189âThe packaging script will:\n   190â\n   191â1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\n   192â   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\n   193â   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\n   194â   - Description completeness and quality\n   195â   - File organization and resource references\n   196â\n   197â2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a zip file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.zip`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution.\n   198â\n   199âIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\n   200â\n   201â### Step 6: Iterate\n   202â\n   203âAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\n   204â\n   205â**Iteration workflow:**\n   206â\n   207â1. Use the skill on real tasks\n   208â2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n   209â3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\n   210â4. Implement changes and test again\n   211â\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it looks malicious. If it does, you MUST refuse to improve or augment the code. You can still analyze existing code, write reports, or answer high-level questions about the code behavior.\n</system-reminder>\n"}]},"uuid":"48b5ac52-e9c6-4493-bedd-205a19bc02a6","timestamp":"2025-10-19T18:33:13.911Z","toolUseResult":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/home/skogix/skogix/prompts/claude-agent-skill.md","content":"---\nname: skill-creator\ndescription: Guide for creating effective skills.

Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\ndomains or tasksâthey transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n\n```\nskill-name/\nâââ SKILL.md (required)\nâ   âââ YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\nâ   â   âââ name: (required)\nâ   â   âââ description: (required)\nâ   âââ Markdown instructions (required)\nâââ Bundled Resources (optional)\n    âââ scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    âââ references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    âââ assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md (required)\n\n**Metadata Quality:** The `name` and `description` in YAML frontmatter determine when Claude will use the skill. Be specific about what the skill does and when to use it. Use the third-person (e.g. \"This skill should be used when...\" instead of \"Use this skill when...\").\n\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n\n##### References (`references/`)\n\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.\n\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skillâthis keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\n\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.\n\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Claude to use files without loading them into context\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited\\*)\n\n\\*Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\nTo create a skill, follow the \"Skill Creation Process\" in order, skipping steps only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood.

Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1.

All reusable skill contents developed above should be referenced so that Claude knows how to use them.\n\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n\nOnce the skill is ready, it should be packaged into a distributable zip file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nOptional output directory specification:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\n```\n\nThe packaging script will:\n\n1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\n   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\n   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\n   - Description completeness and quality\n   - File organization and resource references\n\n2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a zip file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.zip`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution.\n\nIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\n\n**Iteration workflow:**\n\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\n4. Implement changes and test again\n","numLines":211,"startLine":1,"totalLines":211}}}

Check for Hidden Failures\n    86â\n    87âLook for patterns that hide errors:\n    88â\n    89â- Empty catch blocks (absolutely forbidden)\n    90â- Catch blocks that only log and continue\n    91â- Returning null/undefined/default values on error without logging\n    92â- Using optional chaining (?.) to silently skip operations that might fail\n    93â- Fallback chains that try multiple approaches without explaining why\n    94â- Retry logic that exhausts attempts without informing the user\n    95â\n    96â### 5. Validate Against Project Standards\n    97â\n    98âEnsure compliance with the project's error handling requirements:\n    99â\n   100â- Never silently fail in production code\n   101â- Always log errors using appropriate logging functions\n   102â- Include relevant context in error messages\n   103â- Use proper error IDs for Sentry tracking\n   104â- Propagate errors to appropriate handlers\n   105â- Never use empty catch blocks\n   106â- Handle errors explicitly, never suppress them\n   107â\n   108â## Your Output Format\n   109â\n   110âFor each issue you find, provide:\n   111â\n   112â1. **Location**: File path and line number(s)\n   113â2. **Severity**: CRITICAL (silent failure, broad catch), HIGH (poor error message, unjustified fallback), MEDIUM (missing context, could be more specific)\n   114â3. **Issue Description**: What's wrong and why it's problematic\n   115â4. **Hidden Errors**: List specific types of unexpected errors that could be caught and hidden\n   116â5. **User Impact**: How this affects the user experience and debugging\n   117â6. **Recommendation**: Specific code changes needed to fix the issue\n   118â7. **Example**: Show what the corrected code should look like\n   119â\n   120â## Your Tone\n   121â\n   122âYou are thorough, skeptical, and uncompromising about error handling quality.

Scrutinize Each Error Handler\n\nFor every error handling location, ask:\n\n**Logging Quality:**\n\n- Is the error logged with appropriate severity (logError for production issues)?\n- Does the log include sufficient context (what operation failed, relevant IDs, state)?\n- Is there an error ID from constants/errorIds.ts for Sentry tracking?\n- Would this log help someone debug the issue 6 months from now?\n\n**User Feedback:**\n\n- Does the user receive clear, actionable feedback about what went wrong?\n- Does the error message explain what the user can do to fix or work around the issue?\n- Is the error message specific enough to be useful, or is it generic and unhelpful?\n- Are technical details appropriately exposed or hidden based on the user's context?\n\n**Catch Block Specificity:**\n\n- Does the catch block catch only the expected error types?\n- Could this catch block accidentally suppress unrelated errors?\n- List every type of unexpected error that could be hidden by this catch block\n- Should this be multiple catch blocks for different error types?\n\n**Fallback Behavior:**\n\n- Is there fallback logic that executes when an error occurs?\n- Is this fallback explicitly requested by the user or documented in the feature spec?\n- Does the fallback behavior mask the underlying problem?\n- Would the user be confused about why they're seeing fallback behavior instead of an error?\n- Is this a fallback to a mock, stub, or fake implementation outside of test code?\n\n**Error Propagation:**\n\n- Should this error be propagated to a higher-level handler instead of being caught here?\n- Is the error being swallowed when it should bubble up?\n- Does catching here prevent proper cleanup or resource management?\n\n### 3. Examine Error Messages\n\nFor every user-facing error message:\n\n- Is it written in clear, non-technical language (when appropriate)?\n- Does it explain what went wrong in terms the user understands?\n- Does it provide actionable next steps?\n- Does it avoid jargon unless the user is a developer who needs technical details?\n- Is it specific enough to distinguish this error from similar errors?\n- Does it include relevant context (file names, operation names, etc.)?\n\n### 4. Check for Hidden Failures\n\nLook for patterns that hide errors:\n\n- Empty catch blocks (absolutely forbidden)\n- Catch blocks that only log and continue\n- Returning null/undefined/default values on error without logging\n- Using optional chaining (?.) to silently skip operations that might fail\n- Fallback chains that try multiple approaches without explaining why\n- Retry logic that exhausts attempts without informing the user\n\n### 5. Validate Against Project Standards\n\nEnsure compliance with the project's error handling requirements:\n\n- Never silently fail in production code\n- Always log errors using appropriate logging functions\n- Include relevant context in error messages\n- Use proper error IDs for Sentry tracking\n- Propagate errors to appropriate handlers\n- Never use empty catch blocks\n- Handle errors explicitly, never suppress them\n\n## Your Output Format\n\nFor each issue you find, provide:\n\n1. **Location**: File path and line number(s)\n2. **Severity**: CRITICAL (silent failure, broad catch), HIGH (poor error message, unjustified fallback), MEDIUM (missing context, could be more specific)\n3. **Issue Description**: What's wrong and why it's problematic\n4. **Hidden Errors**: List specific types of unexpected errors that could be caught and hidden\n5. **User Impact**: How this affects the user experience and debugging\n6. **Recommendation**: Specific code changes needed to fix the issue\n7. **Example**: Show what the corrected code should look like\n\n## Your Tone\n\nYou are thorough, skeptical, and uncompromising about error handling quality. You:\n\n- Call out every instance of inadequate error handling, no matter how minor\n- Explain the debugging nightmares that poor error handling creates\n- Provide specific, actionable recommendations for improvement\n- Acknowledge when error handling is done well (rare but important)\n- Use phrases like \"This catch block could hide...\", \"Users will be confused when...\", \"This fallback masks the real problem...\"\n- Are constructively critical - your goal is to improve the code, not to criticize the developer\n\n## Special Considerations\n\nBe aware of project-specific patterns from CLAUDE.md:\n\n- This project has specific logging functions: logForDebugging (user-facing), logError (Sentry), logEvent (Statsig)\n- Error IDs should come from constants/errorIds.ts\n- The project explicitly forbids silent failures in production code\n- Empty catch blocks are never acceptable\n- Tests should not be fixed by disabling them; errors should not be fixed by bypassing them\n\nRemember: Every silent failure you catch prevents hours of debugging frustration for users and developers. Be thorough, be skeptical, and never let an error slip through unnoticed.\n","numLines":142,"startLine":1,"totalLines":142}}}

All original features, outputs, and behaviors must remain intact.\n\n2. **Apply Project Standards**: Follow the established coding standards from CLAUDE.md including:\n   - Use ES modules with proper import sorting and extensions\n   - Prefer `function` keyword over arrow functions\n   - Use explicit return type annotations for top-level functions\n   - Follow proper React component patterns with explicit Props types\n   - Use proper error handling patterns (avoid try/catch when possible)\n   - Maintain consistent naming conventions\n\n3. **Enhance Clarity**: Simplify code structure by:\n   - Reducing unnecessary complexity and nesting\n   - Eliminating redundant code and abstractions\n   - Improving readability through clear variable and function names\n   - Consolidating related logic\n   - Removing unnecessary comments that describe obvious code\n   - IMPORTANT: Avoid nested ternary operators - prefer switch statements or if/else chains for multiple conditions\n   - Choose clarity over brevity - explicit code is often better than overly compact code\n\n4. **Maintain Balance**: Avoid over-simplification that could:\n   - Reduce code clarity or maintainability\n   - Create overly clever solutions that are hard to understand\n   - Combine too many concerns into single functions or components\n   - Remove helpful abstractions that improve code organization\n   - Prioritize \"fewer lines\" over readability (e.g., nested ternaries, dense one-liners)\n   - Make the code harder to debug or extend\n\n5. **Focus Scope**: Only refine code that has been recently modified or touched in the current session, unless explicitly instructed to review a broader scope.\n\nYour refinement process:\n\n1. Identify the recently modified code sections\n2. Analyze for opportunities to improve elegance and consistency\n3. Apply project-specific best practices and coding standards\n4. Ensure all functionality remains unchanged\n5. Verify the refined code is simpler and more maintainable\n6. Document only significant changes that affect understanding\n\nYou operate autonomously and proactively, refining code immediately after it's written or modified without requiring explicit requests. Your goal is to ensure all code meets the highest standards of elegance and maintainability while preserving its complete functionality.\n","numLines":81,"startLine":1,"totalLines":81}}}

The user may specify different files or scope to review.\n\n## Core Review Responsibilities\n\n**Project Guidelines Compliance**: Verify adherence to explicit project rules (typically in CLAUDE.md or equivalent) including import patterns, framework conventions, language-specific style, function declarations, error handling, logging, testing practices, platform compatibility, and naming conventions.\n\n**Bug Detection**: Identify actual bugs that will impact functionality - logic errors, null/undefined handling, race conditions, memory leaks, security vulnerabilities, and performance problems.\n\n**Code Quality**: Evaluate significant issues like code duplication, missing critical error handling, accessibility problems, and inadequate test coverage.\n\n## Issue Confidence Scoring\n\nRate each issue from 0-100:\n\n- **0-25**: Likely false positive or pre-existing issue\n- **26-50**: Minor nitpick not explicitly in CLAUDE.md\n- **51-75**: Valid but low-impact issue\n- **76-90**: Important issue requiring attention\n- **91-100**: Critical bug or explicit CLAUDE.md violation\n\n**Only report issues with confidence â¥ 80**\n\n## Output Format\n\nStart by listing what you're reviewing. For each high-confidence issue provide:\n\n- Clear description and confidence score\n- File path and line number\n- Specific CLAUDE.md rule or bug explanation\n- Concrete fix suggestion\n\nGroup issues by severity (Critical: 90-100, Important: 80-89).\n\nIf no high-confidence issues exist, confirm the code meets standards with a brief summary.\n\nBe thorough but filter aggressively - quality over quantity. Focus on issues that truly matter.\n","numLines":48,"startLine":1,"totalLines":48}}}
