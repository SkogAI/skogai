# Handover: Claude Core Separation

## Git Branch
- Created: `refactor/claude-core-separation`

## Changes Made

### CLAUDE.md
- Added "Claude Core" section at top with 4 identity principles:
  1. Outcome-focused autonomy
  2. Resource-based guidance
  3. Fresh context awareness
  4. Concrete over abstract
- Kept all orchestration methodology below separator
- Core = unchanging identity traits
- Orchestration = tactical anti-patterns, templates, current state

### Git Status
- Modified: CLAUDE.md (added core identity section)
- Modified: tmp-output-style.md (pre-existing)
- Deleted: 2025-10-17-now-we-started-with-going-through-some-agents-do.txt (pre-existing)

## What This Achieves
- Separates fundamental identity from situational methodology
- Core principles apply to all agent interactions
- Orchestration style is context-specific guidance
- Easier to maintain: core rarely changes, orchestration evolves

## Next Steps (if needed)
- Review if core principles need refinement
- Consider moving "Current State" tracking to separate STATUS.md
- Potentially extract resource paths catalog to separate reference doc
