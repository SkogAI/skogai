Agent Validation Report

Summary

Found 12 agent files in /home/skogix/skogix/prompts/. Analysis shows mixed quality with several critical issues.

---

Critical Issues (Priority: High)

1. claude-style-core.md - NOT an agent file

Issue: Missing required YAML frontmatter (no name, description, color fields)

- This appears to be a core identity/style guide, not a specialized agent
- Should either be converted to proper agent format or moved out of agents directory

2. claude-style-orchestration.md - NOT an agent file

Issue: Missing required YAML frontmatter

- This is orchestration documentation, not an agent
- Should be relocated to appropriate documentation directory

3. claude-agent-skill.md - MISSING FILE

Issue: File referenced by glob but failed to load

- Needs investigation

---

Valid Agents with Issues

4. claude-agent-agent.md (agent-expert)

Status: ✅ Valid structure, minor improvements needed

Strengths:

- Comprehensive frontmatter with good examples
- Detailed agent creation workflow
- Clear expertise areas and responsibilities

Issues:

- File location reference error: Says agents should be created in cli-tool/components/agents/ but these are typically in .claude/agents/
- Installation command references non-standard path
- Overly prescriptive in some sections

Recommendations:

- Update file paths: /home/skogix/skogix/prompts/claude-agent-agent.md lines 400-410, 469-477
- Simplify agent creation workflow to focus on outcomes vs steps

---

5. code-type-designer.md (type-design-analyzer)

Status: ✅ Valid structure, excellent quality

Strengths:

- Clear frontmatter with specific examples
- Comprehensive analysis framework
- Well-defined rating system
- Good balance of detail

Issues:

- model: inherit field not standard (may need verification)
- No critical issues

Recommendations:

- Verify model: inherit is supported syntax

---

6. code-simplifier.md (code-simplifier)

Status: ✅ Valid structure, good quality

Strengths:

- Clear trigger conditions in examples
- Well-defined expertise areas
- Balanced approach to simplification

Issues:

- model: opus field - should verify this is correct/supported
- Example format in description could be more concise

Recommendations:

- Consider updating to use standard model field format

---

7. code-shower.md (silent-failure-hunter)

Status: ✅ Valid structure, excellent quality

Strengths:

- Comprehensive error handling focus
- Clear review process
- Specific output format
- Good examples in frontmatter

Issues:

- Very long content (142 lines) - may benefit from breaking into sub-sections
- Some repetition in review process

Recommendations:

- Consider condensing repetitive sections
- Excellent specialized agent, no critical changes needed

---

8. code-reviewer.md (code-reviewer)

Status: ✅ Valid structure, good quality

Strengths:

- Clear confidence scoring system
- Well-defined scope
- Practical output format

Issues:

- model: opus should be verified
- Examples in description are verbose
- Could be more specific about CLAUDE.md integration

Recommendations:

- Streamline description examples

---

9. code-flow-mapper.md (code-flow-mapper)

Status: ⚠️ Valid but problematic

Issues:

- Has tools: field listing many tools - this is unusual for agent format
- References external file INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md in specific directory pattern
- Very short content (only 19 lines)
- Rigid output format requirement
- Depends on another agent's output

Recommendations:

- Remove tools: field or document why it's needed
- Make agent more self-contained
- Add more context about what flow mapping entails
- Relax rigid output format requirement

---

10. code-architect.md (code-architect)

Status: ⚠️ Valid but has issues

Issues:

- Has tools: field (non-standard)
- model: sonnet (verify syntax)
- Very terse content (only 35 lines)
- Lacks concrete examples in content
- Missing clear process workflow

Recommendations:

- Remove tools: field or document necessity
- Expand with concrete architecture examples
- Add specific decision-making frameworks
- Include more detailed output templates

---

11. claude-agent-command.md (command-expert)

Status: ✅ Valid structure, comprehensive

Strengths:

- Excellent frontmatter with clear examples
- Comprehensive command creation workflow
- Good template examples
- Clear testing and quality assurance sections

Issues:

- File location references cli-tool/components/commands/ (may be project-specific)
- Very long (467 lines) - may benefit from modularization
- Some repetition in templates

Recommendations:

- Verify file path conventions match project structure
- Consider splitting into core + reference sections

---

12. code-explorer.md (code-explorer)

Status: ⚠️ Valid but minimal

Issues:

- Has tools: field (non-standard)
- model: sonnet (verify syntax)
- Very short content (57 lines)
- Lacks concrete examples
- No specific methodology details

Recommendations:

- Remove tools: field
- Add concrete code exploration examples
- Expand analysis methodology
- Include sample output formats

Key Findings

Non-Agent Files (Should be relocated)

1. /home/skogix/skogix/prompts/claude-style-core.md - Core identity doc
2. /home/skogix/skogix/prompts/claude-style-orchestration.md - Orchestration guide

Non-Standard Fields Found

- tools: field in 3 agents (code-flow-mapper, code-architect, code-explorer)
- model: field variations (opus, sonnet, inherit) - verify these are supported

Quality Tiers

Tier 1 (Excellent): code-type-designer, code-shower, code-simplifier, code-reviewer, claude-agent-command
Tier 2 (Good but needs work): claude-agent-agent
Tier 3 (Needs improvement): code-flow-mapper, code-architect, code-explorer

---

Recommended Actions

1. Relocate non-agent files to appropriate directories
2. Standardize model field syntax across all agents
3. Remove or document tools: field usage
4. Expand minimal agents (code-flow-mapper, code-architect, code-explorer) with examples
5. Fix path references in claude-agent-agent.md
6. Verify all model field values are supported
