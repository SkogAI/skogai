prompt: |
  agent-expert(Analyze prompts directory structure)

  Prompt:
   Please examine the contents of /home/skogix/skogix/prompts/ directory to understand what agent definitions and related files exist there. The user mentioned that some files may
   have been moved around and names might be "borked" (incorrect/broken).

   Your task:
   1. Explore the directory structure of prompts/
   2. Identify all agent-related files (especially in .claude/agents/ if it exists there)
   3. Read the agent definition files to understand their purpose and structure
   4. Note any naming inconsistencies, structural issues, or organizational problems
   5. Provide a clear summary of what agents exist, their purposes, and any issues you found

   Return a comprehensive report about the agents in that directory including their current state and any recommendations for fixes or improvements.
  Response:
  Perfect! Now I have a complete understanding. Let me create a comprehensive report:

# Agent Directory Analysis Report

Executive Summary

The /home/skogix/skogix/prompts/ directory contains a complex but mostly well-organized collection of agent definitions, style guides, and configuration files. There are several
structural issues including broken symlinks, duplicate files, naming inconsistencies, and a typo in one agent definition.

# Issues Identified

Critical Issues

1. Broken Symlinks ‚ùå

Location: /home/skogix/skogix/prompts/.claude/agents/

agent-expert.md -> ../../prompts/claude-agent-agent.md # BROKEN
command-expert.md -> ../../prompts/claude-agent-command.md # BROKEN

Problem: Symlinks use incorrect relative paths. From /home/skogix/skogix/prompts/.claude/agents/, the path ../../prompts/ resolves to /home/skogix/skogix/../prompts/ which
doesn't exist.

Fix: Should be ../claude-agent-agent.md and ../claude-agent-command.md (without the ../../prompts/ prefix)

2. Typo in code-explorer.md ‚ùå

Location: /home/skogix/skogix/prompts/.claude/agents/code-explorer.md

Line 4:
tools: Glob, Grep, LS, Read, NotebookRead, WebFetch, TodoWrite, WebSearch, KillShellias, BashOutput

Issue: KillShellias should be KillShell (extra "ias" at the end)

3. Agent Filename Mismatches ‚ö†Ô∏è

Two agents have filenames that don't match their internal names:

| Filename              | Internal Name         | Issue                        |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| code-shower.md        | silent-failure-hunter | Completely different concept |
| code-type-designer.md | type-design-analyzer  | Similar but inconsistent     |

Impact: Users looking for "code-shower" won't find what they expect. The filename suggests showing code, but the agent hunts for silent failures.

Organizational Issues

4. Duplicate Files üìÇ

Multiple files exist in both /home/skogix/skogix/.claude/ and /home/skogix/skogix/prompts/:

Identical Duplicates:

- code-architect.md
- code-reviewer.md
- code-simplifier.md
- claude-style-core.md
- claude-style-orchestration.md

Near-Identical (except for the typo):

- code-explorer.md

Meta-agents:

- claude-agent-agent.md (in root .claude/agents/)
- claude-agent-command.md (in root .claude/agents/)
- claude-agent-skill.md (in root .claude/agents/)

These exist in prompts/ root AND are referenced by broken symlinks in prompts/.claude/agents/

5. Inconsistent Structure üîÄ

Two .claude directories:

- /home/skogix/skogix/.claude/ - Main, active configuration
- /home/skogix/skogix/prompts/.claude/ - Development/testing copy?

Purpose unclear: Why maintain two separate .claude structures?

6. Invalid JSON ‚ö†Ô∏è

Location: /home/skogix/skogix/prompts/claude-style-settings.json

--{
"outputStyle": "claude-style-settings.json"
}

Issue: Invalid JSON (starts with --). This appears to be a reference/comment rather than actual configuration.

# Recommendations

# Immediate Fixes (High Priority)

1. Fix the typo in code-explorer.md:

## Change from

tools: Glob, Grep, LS, Read, NotebookRead, WebFetch, TodoWrite, WebSearch, KillShellias, BashOutput

## To

tools: Glob, Grep, LS, Read, NotebookRead, WebFetch, TodoWrite, WebSearch, KillShell, BashOutput 2. Fix or remove broken symlinks:

- Option A: Fix the symlink paths
- Option B: Copy the actual files instead of using symlinks
- Option C: Remove the broken symlinks entirely

3. Rename mismatched agent files:
   mv code-shower.md silent-failure-hunter.md
   mv code-type-designer.md type-design-analyzer.md

# Organizational Improvements (Medium Priority)

4. Consolidate duplicate files:

- Decide which location is canonical
- Remove duplicates from the other location
- Consider if prompts/ is a development directory or should be cleaned up

5. Clarify directory purpose:

- Document what /home/skogix/skogix/prompts/ is for
- If it's for development/testing, add a README
- If it's obsolete, clean it up

6. Move unique agents to main .claude directory:

## Move these from prompts/.claude/agents/ to .claude/agents/

- silent-failure-hunter.md (after renaming)
- type-design-analyzer.md (after renaming)
- code-flow-mapper.md

# Long-term Improvements (Low Priority)

7. Add missing frontmatter:

- code-simplifier.md - missing color
- skill-creator.md - missing color

8. Standardize agent descriptions:

- Some agents have 3-4 examples, others have fewer
- Ensure all have practical, realistic examples
- Use consistent formatting

9. Create agent registry/index:

- Document all available agents
- Include when to use each one
- Cross-reference related agents

10. Fix invalid JSON:

- Either fix /home/skogix/skogix/prompts/claude-style-settings.json
- Or remove it if it's just a reference note

# Conclusion

The agent system is well-designed with high-quality, specialized agents covering different aspects of software development. However, there are organizational issues stemming from
what appears to be a migration or reorganization in progress:

1. The main .claude/ directory contains 7 working agents
2. The prompts/.claude/ directory appears to be a development/testing area with 3 additional agents and broken symlinks
3. Several files are duplicated between locations
4. Some agents have filename/name mismatches that could confuse users

Primary recommendation: Clean up the prompts/ directory structure, fix the typo in code-explorer.md, rename mismatched agents, and migrate the unique agents
(silent-failure-hunter, type-design-analyzer, code-flow-mapper) to the main .claude/agents/ directory.
