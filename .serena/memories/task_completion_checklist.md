# Task Completion Checklist

## For Configuration Changes
1. Verify changes are saved to appropriate files
2. Check that CLAUDE.md instructions are followed
3. Ensure any new instructions are appended to the skogix additions section

## For Documentation Updates
1. Ensure markdown formatting is correct
2. Verify all file references use @ prefix notation
3. Check that documentation is clear and purposeful

## For Git Operations
1. Check git status after any changes
2. Ensure you're on the correct branch (usually develop)
3. Never commit unless explicitly asked by skogix

## General Reminders
- **NEVER** retry failed commands - inform skogix immediately
- **AVOID** using find/grep commands
- **ALWAYS** follow CLAUDE.md instructions exactly
- **DO NOT** create unnecessary files
- **PREFER** editing existing files over creating new ones

## Since This is Configuration-Only
- No build commands to run
- No tests to execute
- No linting required
- No compilation steps

## Communication with User
- Be concise and direct
- Report failures immediately without retrying
- Ask for clarification when instructions are unclear
