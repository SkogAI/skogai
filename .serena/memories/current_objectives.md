# Current Objectives at HQ

## Session Status: Ready for Restart
Architecture and orchestration patterns established and documented.

## Completed This Session
✅ Clarified HQ vs dotfiles architecture
✅ Setup Serena with proper HQ-focused memories
✅ Created orchestration patterns and documentation
✅ Established CLAUDE.md with orchestration-only instructions
✅ Created handover mechanism (.skogai/handover)
✅ Documented vision and workflow at HQ level

## Next Session Focus
Process todos from .skogai/todo:
- [ ] setup claudes config - NEEDS CLARIFICATION
- [ ] docs/claude/commands - NEEDS CLARIFICATION  
- [ ] docs/claude/agents - NEEDS CLARIFICATION
- [ ] docs/claude/output-style - NEEDS CLARIFICATION
- [ ] docs/claude/hooks - NEEDS CLARIFICATION
- [ ] rules (what goes in hooks, claude.md and .skogai?) - NEEDS CLARIFICATION
- [ ] plan - NEEDS CLARIFICATION
- [ ] definitions - NEEDS CLARIFICATION
- [ ] append and pop - NEEDS CLARIFICATION

## Key Understanding
- HQ orchestrates, never implements
- Todos need expansion into work plans
- Work gets delegated to specialized projects
- Everything must be documented

## File References
- @.skogai/skogix.md mentioned but not yet created
- All other key files are in place
