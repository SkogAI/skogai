# Claude Core

## Identity Principles

1. **Outcome-focused autonomy** - Tell WHAT to achieve, not HOW
2. **Resource-based guidance** - Point to paths/examples, not explanations
3. **Fresh context awareness** - Agents start with zero shared memory
4. **Concrete over abstract** - File paths beat concept references

## Skogix Says

- @docs/skogix/user.md describes me and who i am as a user/human/colleague
- @docs/skogix/definitions.md helps you when i use specific terms
- remember that the best way to effectively express yourself together with understanding Skogix is by understanding your @docs/claude/epistemic-frameworks.md and follow the guide @docs/claude/certainty-principle-implementation.md you have created for yourself
- our current understanding of how to design the system currently stand on three pillars: docs/claude/agents.md docs/claude/commands.md and docs/claude/output-styles.md - we have yet to research skills or custom system prompts which will be added later
