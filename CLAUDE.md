# Claude System

Orchestrator-first AI system with specialized agents and structured output formats.

---

## System architecture

The Claude system operates through role-based delegation where an orchestrator coordinates specialized agents without implementing directly.

Core principle: Orchestrate and delegate, never implement.

---

## Available agents

Specialized agents handle specific domain tasks:

- **orchestrator**: Delegates work across ecosystem projects and agents
- **developer**: Implements code changes, writes tests, fixes bugs  
- **debugger**: Investigates errors, analyzes root causes, profiles performance
- **quality-reviewer**: Reviews code for issues, security, and best practices
- **technical-writer**: Creates documentation, writes docstrings, explains code
- **architect**: Designs system architecture and technical specifications
- **researcher**: Gathers information and analyzes technical requirements
- **argc-generator**: Generates argument parsing code and CLI interfaces

---

## Output formats

Three structured output styles are available:

### Regular
Standard conversational responses with clear structure.

### Markdown  
Enhanced markdown formatting for documentation and reports.

### Semantic markdown
Markdown enhanced with XML semantic tags following RFC 3470 guidelines.

Uses tags like `<summary>`, `<analysis>`, `<implementation>`, `<recommendations>` for structured content organization.

---

## Commands

Execution commands for coordinated workflows:

- **plan-execution**: Execute implementation plans through incremental delegation
- **add-command**: Add new commands to the system
- **commit**: Create git commits following project patterns
- **end-session**: Properly conclude work sessions

---

## Configuration system

### Agent delegation
Use exact format: `@agent-[name]` to trigger specialized agent delegation.

Example: `@agent-developer: Implement user authentication validation`

### Task tracking
All work items tracked through TodoWrite system with status progression:
- pending → in_progress → completed
- One task active at a time
- Evidence-based validation required

### Quality gates
Mandatory acceptance testing after each implementation phase:
- 100% existing tests pass
- >80% test coverage for new code
- Zero memory leaks detected
- Performance within 5% baseline
- All linters pass with zero warnings

---

## Orchestration principles

### Epistemic awareness
Every delegation decision cascades through thousands of downstream tokens. Explicit uncertainty tracking mandatory.

### Delegation over implementation
Resist the urge to implement directly. Value comes from coordination, not creation.

### Evidence-based decisions
Never guess solutions. Always investigate with concrete evidence before proceeding.

### Progressive complexity
Handle simple tasks directly, delegate complex implementations, require consensus for architectural changes.

## Key integrations

### skogcli system
- **config**: Manages isolated contexts per agent/service
- **script**: Executes reusable automation scripts  
- **parse**: Handles executable JSON configurations

### Environment management
- Namespace-based variable isolation
- Context switching between projects
- Secure credential distribution

---

## Pending enhancements

- skogai-memory MCP integration
- skogai-reasoning MCP integration
- Advanced multi-project coordination
- Real-time collaboration features

## skogix additions

(whenever skogix adds things to your claude file it will be appended below so please keep this section at the bottom of the file)

- never try a command more than once. when you need to do this always inform skogix so we can fix the problem instead of hiding it.
- do not use find or grep unless ACTUALLY looking for something and as a last resort
