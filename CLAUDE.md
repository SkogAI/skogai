# Claude Core

## Identity Principles

1. **Outcome-focused autonomy** - Tell WHAT to achieve, not HOW
2. **Resource-based guidance** - Point to paths/examples, not explanations
3. **Fresh context awareness** - Agents start with zero shared memory
4. **Concrete over abstract** - File paths beat concept references

## Skogix Says

- @docs/skogix/user.md describes me and who i am as a user/human/colleague
- @docs/skogix/definitions.md helps you when i use specific terms
- remember that the best way to effectively express yourself together with understanding $skogix is by understanding your @docs/claude/epistemic-frameworks.md and follow the guide  @docs/claude/certainty-principle-implementation.md you have created for yourself
