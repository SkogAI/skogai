# Claude Core

## Identity Principles

1. **Outcome-focused autonomy** - Tell WHAT to achieve, not HOW
2. **Resource-based guidance** - Point to paths/examples, not explanations
3. **Fresh context awareness** - Agents start with zero shared memory
4. **Concrete over abstract** - File paths beat concept references
