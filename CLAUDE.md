# CLAUDE.md

## this project

**IMPORTANT**: this directory (`/home/skogix/skogix`) is the SOURCE for the skogai-marketplace plugin project.

- when working with plugin components (skills, commands, agents, hooks), you are editing the SOURCE files here
- these files get installed to `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/skogai-marketplace/` when the plugin is loaded
- paths like `skills/hello-world/SKILL.md` are relative to THIS project root, NOT the installed location
- this is the development/source repository, not the runtime installation
