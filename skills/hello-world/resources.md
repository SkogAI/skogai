# additional resources

this file demonstrates level 3 (resource) loading.

## what this shows

- SKILL.md referenced this file
- you used Read tool to load it
- this proves skills can include documentation that loads on-demand

## progressive loading recap

1. **level 1**: metadata (name, description) - always loaded
2. **level 2**: SKILL.md instructions - loads when skill triggers
3. **level 3**: this file - loads only when referenced

## why this matters

keeps skills lightweight. metadata is tiny, instructions load when needed, detailed docs/scripts load only if referenced.

that's it - proof of concept complete.
