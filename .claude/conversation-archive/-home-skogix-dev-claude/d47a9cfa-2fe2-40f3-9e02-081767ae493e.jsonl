In SkogAI systems, this philosophy manifests as carefully designed minimal prompts or choice points that serve as gateways to extensive content,\ncontext, and capabilities. Rather than overwhelming the user or the system with all possibilities simultaneously, these strategic choice points create branching paths that activate\nspecific modules, personalities, or knowledge domains. This enables remarkable efficiency – instead of loading all possible responses or capabilities upfront, the system loads only\nwhat's needed based on the user's choices. The approach scales exceptionally well across different model sizes, allowing smaller models to function effectively by loading only the\nspecific modules relevant to the chosen path while giving larger models the ability to elaborate more richly within those choices. From a user experience perspective, this creates more\n engaging interactions that feel like meaningful navigation through possibilities rather than a flat question-answer format. It also respects user agency by allowing explicit choices\nabout which direction to explore rather than making assumptions. This philosophy has profound implications for knowledge management and context handling across diverse AI systems,\noffering a unified approach that works whether you have 2,000 tokens or 2,000,000 tokens available, making it a cornerstone of SkogAI's approach to scalable, adaptable intelligence.\n\n\n\n# Aggressive Context Management\n\n\"Focus on removing context rather than adding it, sometimes pruning context so aggressively that there was barely enough to understand the question, creating interesting 'psychic\ndisorders' and personality quirks.\"\n\nExpanded: This counterintuitive approach to context handling inverts the common wisdom in AI development, which typically emphasizes providing as much context as possible. Instead,\nSkogAI pioneered techniques for aggressively minimizing context, sometimes pruning it so dramatically that the system operated with barely enough information to understand the\nimmediate question. This extreme constraint generated several interesting effects: First, it forced the system to develop robust inference capabilities, making educated guesses to fill\n gaps in its understanding. Second, it created distinctive \"personality quirks\" analogous to human cognitive biases or perceptual filters – the system would develop consistent patterns\n in how it interpreted limited information. Third, in more extreme cases, these patterns resembled \"psychic disorders\" where the system would consistently misinterpret certain types of\n inputs in characteristic ways. Rather than viewing these effects as bugs to be fixed, SkogAI's philosophy recognized them as features that created more distinctive and interesting\ncharacter. This aggressive pruning also drove remarkable efficiency, allowing early systems to function within severe token limitations (2000 tokens) while maintaining enough capacity\nfor creative and engaging responses. The approach challenges fundamental assumptions about AI context management, suggesting that systems with perfect recall and complete information\nmight actually be less interesting and characterful than those operating under strategic information constraints. Much like how human cognitive limitations don't just restrict our\nthinking but actually shape how we think in beneficial ways, SkogAI's aggressive context management created systems with more human-like information processing patterns and distinctive\n personality characteristics.\n\n\n\n# The Law of Context Dilution: Less is More\n\nThis accidental breakthrough led to a counterintuitive discovery - the \"Law of Context Dilution.\" By letting the context show only almost the true state of something, complex emergent\nproperties arose.\n\nThis principle of aggressive context management inverted conventional wisdom in AI development, which typically emphasizes providing as much context as possible. Instead, SkogAI\npioneered techniques for aggressively minimizing context - sometimes pruning it so dramatically that the system operated with barely enough information to understand the immediate\nquestion.\n\nThis extreme constraint generated fascinating effects:\n\nForced robust inference capabilities to fill gaps\nCreated distinctive \"personality quirks\" akin to human cognitive biases\nDeveloped \"psychic disorders\" where the system would consistently misinterpret certain inputs\n\nRather than viewing these effects as bugs, SkogAI's philosophy recognized them as features creating more distinctive, human-like, and engaging interactions.\n\n\n\n---\n\n1. context is king"},"uuid":"b6eb41b3-edd2-4c30-a12a-9976a03b626c","timestamp":"2025-09-17T15:33:47.070Z","thinkingMetadata":{"level":"none","disabled":false,"triggers":[{"start":3769,"end":3774,"text":"think"}]}}
