That's the critical lesson here. The general-purpose agent:\n\n1. **Ignored my instructions** about the branch name\n2. **Created its own branch** (`feature/version-0.0.4`) instead of using `feature/prepare-release-0.0.4`\n3. **Reported \"success\"** even though it did the wrong thing\n\nWhile the github-agent followed instructions precisely - it used the exact branch names and commands I specified.\n\nSo the rule should be:\n- **GitHub-agent**: For ALL git operations (it listens and follows git-flow properly)\n- **General-purpose agent**: NEVER for anything involving git - it won't follow instructions and will do whatever it wants\n\nThe general-purpose agent has too much freedom and won't respect the specific workflow constraints. It's like giving someone admin access who doesn't follow the team's procedures - they'll just do things their own way.\n\nExample: <summary>Implemented HID keyboard functionality for ESP32.
