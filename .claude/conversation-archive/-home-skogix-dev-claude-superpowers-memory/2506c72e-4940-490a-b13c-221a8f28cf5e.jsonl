What happened, what was built/discussed. Use <summary></summary> tags.\n\nUser: please take it easy again. slow down\n\nAgent: You're right, I'm going too fast. \n\nThe rcrc file is now updated to point to `/home/skogix/dev/skogai-dotfiles`. \n\nWhat would you like to do next?\n\n---\n\nUser: rcrc default path is .dotfiles\n\nuse lsrc -d /home/skogix/dev/skogai-dotfiles to look etc\n\nAgent: Good! Now it shows the correct paths from our dev directory. I see CLAUDE.md would be symlinked to `~/.CLAUDE.md` - that might not be what we want.\n\n---\n\nUser: check man how to rcup a single file to start so we can run `rcup -d /home/skogix/dev/skogai-dotfiles` after\n\nAgent: So you can specify individual files at the end of the rcup command. Let's try with just zshrc first:\n\nIt's asking about overwriting. Let's check what's currently there:\n\nYour current ~/.zshrc is a regular file. If you want to replace it with a symlink to the dev version, you could use the `-f` flag to force it, or manually remove it first.\n\n---\n\nUser: now it should point the correct way. a last sanity check before *I* run rcup?\n\nAgent: Let's do a final sanity check before you run rcup:\n\nPerfect! ✅ \n- Your `~/.rcrc` now points to `/home/skogix/dev/skogai-dotfiles`\n- `lsrc` shows it will symlink from the dev directory\n- README.md and other .md files are excluded (won't be symlinked)\n- Only files we've added so far: rcrc, zshrc, zshenv, gitconfig, nvmrc, and config/\n\nReady to run `rcup` when you are!\n\n---\n\nUser: looks correct right?\n\nAgent: Perfect! ✅ Everything is working correctly:\n\n- `~/.rcrc` → symlinked to dev rcrc\n- `~/.zshrc` → symlinked to dev zshrc  \n- `~/.config/i3/` → files symlinked to dev config/i3/\n\nThe symlinks are all pointing to `/home/skogix/dev/skogai-dotfiles/` as expected. Your dotfiles are now live from the dev directory!\n\nNow let's continue building this repo. Should we:\n1. Review and add gitconfig next?\n2. Create a proper .gitignore?\n3. Start reviewing the config/ directory?\n\nWhat's your priority?\n\n---\n\nUser: now we can start to speed up a bit. before anything is added to git it should be asked and confirmed with me though\n\nAgent: I'll help you review and add more dotfiles at a faster pace, but I'll always ask for your confirmation before staging anything to git.\n\nLet me check what git-related files you have:\n\n---\n\nUser: no, ./ is good enough please dont do stupid things\n\nAgent: You're right, let me check what git-related files exist in the current dotfiles directory:\n\n**Git files found:**\n\n1. **gitconfig** - Has your git configuration with:\n   - User details and SSH signing key\n   - Delta for better diffs\n   - Git-flow configuration\n   - Some fun quantum-themed aliases\n   - **Should add to repo?**\n\n2. **.gitignore** - Currently just has `.aider*`\n   - **Should expand with more common ignores?**\n\nWant to add gitconfig to the repo and expand .gitignore?\n\n---\n\nUser: now instead, just give me top five questionmarks that sticks out from what i tell you. @gitconfig ?\n\nAgent: Looking at your gitconfig, here are the top 5 questionmarks:\n\n1. **Line 45**: `hooks = /home/skogix/skogai/.git/hooks` - Points to a different repo's hooks directory, not the dotfiles repo\n\n2. **Line 8**: `directory = /home/skogix/skogai` - Safe directory points to different repo, might want to add the dotfiles repo too\n\n3. **Line 4**: SSH signing key is exposed (though this is public info, some prefer using skogcli for consistency)\n\n4. **Lines 50-57**: Quantum-themed aliases - Fun but... really? 😄\n\n5. **Line 25**: `helper = store` - Less secure than using system keyring, stores credentials in plain text\n\nShould we fix the hooks path and safe directory issues?\n\nExample: <summary>Implemented HID keyboard functionality for ESP32.
