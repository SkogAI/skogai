Let me check the package.json to understand what scripts are available:\n\nNow let me run the dev script as requested:\n\nThere's a missing module error. Let me check what files exist in the performance directory:\n\nThe file exists as a TypeScript file. Let me check the import statement in PerformanceValidator.ts:\n\nThe issue is that the imports are using `.js` extensions but the files are TypeScript files with `.ts` extensions. Let me fix these imports:\n\nNow let me check if there are similar import issues in other files:\n\nLet me check and fix those files as well:\n\nNow let me check if there are any more .js imports to fix:\n\nThere are still .js imports in multiple files. Let me fix them all:\n\nGood, now let me update the todo list and run the dev script:\n\n## Summary\n\nI haven't done any earlier work in this session, but I've just fixed the import issues in your TypeScript project. The problem was that the TypeScript files were trying to import modules with `.js` extensions when they should be importing without extensions (since TypeScript resolves `.ts` files automatically).\n\nThe project is a \"prompt-optimization-system\" that appears to be a framework for optimizing AI prompts with component analysis and scoring. \n\nI fixed all the incorrect `.js` imports across the codebase and successfully ran `npm run dev`. The application now starts without module resolution errors."}]},"uuid":"4b715695-64dd-4fcc-8217-81cc21bb7438","timestamp":"2025-11-01T03:52:57.371Z"}
