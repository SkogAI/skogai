It's showing all the changes in your current feature branch compared to develop:\n\n- Added the Argcfile.sh with the new argc commands\n- Created the git helper scripts in .claude/scripts/\n- Updated CLAUDE.md and docs/git.md with git-flow documentation\n- Added Claude settings and agent configurations\n\nThe output looks clean and professional - it's the standard git diff format showing exactly what will be merged into develop when you finish this feature. This is the proper git-flow way to review your feature's changes before completing it.\n\nThe command is doing exactly what it should: comparing your `feature/git-flow-integration` branch against `develop` to show all modifications introduced by this feature.\n\n---\n\nUser: oh my god i forgot about those! please remove the scripts and update the command and agent to use Bash(argc:*) instead\n\nAgent: Done!
