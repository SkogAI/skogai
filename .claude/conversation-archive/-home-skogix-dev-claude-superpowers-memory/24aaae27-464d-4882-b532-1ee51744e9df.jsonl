Let me try broader searches to find any configuration-related work:\n\nThe episodic memory search returned no results for configuration-related conversations. This suggests either:\n\n1. **This is a fresh codebase** - The recent git commits show \"feat: add skogai configuration, scripts, and documentation\" and \"feat: add claude introduction documentation\" from early setup, but no prior conversation history has been archived yet.\n\n2. **No previous conversations were saved** - The conversation archive may be empty or these topics weren't discussed in previous sessions.\n\nLet me check the actual files in the current codebase to understand what configurations exist:\n\n### Summary\n\nNo historical conversations about configuration management were found in the episodic memory archive. However, analysis of the current codebase reveals an established configuration pattern being used:\n\n**Current Configuration Setup:**\n\nThe project uses a **multi-server MCP (Model Context Protocol) configuration** defined in `/home/skogix/skogix/.mcp.json`. This file configures five external servers/tools:\n\n1. **skill-seeker** - Python-based MCP server running Claude skill-seeker tool\n2. **tools** - Node-based NPX tool wrapper pointing to `/home/skogix/skogai/tools`\n3. **loremaster** - NPX-based tool for lore management (specialized variant of tools)\n4. **librarian** - NPX-based tool for library operations (specialized variant of tools)\n5. **skogai-memory** - Python/uvx-based memory management system\n\nEach server specifies:\n- A command to execute (python3, npx, uvx)\n- Command arguments including paths to server scripts\n- Working directory context (cwd)\n\n**Configuration Management Patterns:**\n\nThe project also demonstrates an **argc-based CLI pattern** in `/home/skogix/skogix/Argcfile.sh`. This is a validation-first approach for AI-safe command execution:\n\n- **Static validation** - Options with fixed choices: `--env[dev|qa|prod]`, `--target[all|frontend|backend|docs]`\n- **Dynamic validation** - Runtime system state: `_available_ports()`, `_git_branches()`, `_installed_mcps()`\n- **Context-aware validation** - Environment variables and agent-scoped state (e.g., `SKOGAI_AGENT_HOME`)\n- **Configuration patterns** - Commands for editing configs with `config-edit`, MCP server operations with `mcp`\n\nThe design emphasizes safety by construction: invalid inputs are prevented at the CLI boundary rather than through defensive code, making it suitable for AI agent operation.\n\n### Sources\n\nNo previous conversations were archived matching configuration-related queries. This appears to be either a fresh project or the conversation archive is empty. Configuration work is evident in current codebase files:\n\n- `/home/skogix/skogix/.mcp.json` - MCP server configuration (lines 1-27)\n- `/home/skogix/skogix/Argcfile.sh` - argc-based CLI with validation patterns (lines 1-582)\n- `/home/skogix/skogix/CLAUDE.md` - Project documentation reference (lines 1-6)"}]},"uuid":"c5b90984-9255-4fc9-9003-d735cac47c90","timestamp":"2025-11-01T02:48:26.511Z"}
