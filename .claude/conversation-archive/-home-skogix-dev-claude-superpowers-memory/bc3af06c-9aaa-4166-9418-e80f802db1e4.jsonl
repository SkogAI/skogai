Include:\n\n- What triggered this learning\n- Why it matters for future work\n- How to recognize when to apply it\n- Exceptions or edge cases discovered\n\n## Auto-Detection Mode\n\nIf no specific learning provided:\n1. Analyze recent conversation for patterns\n2. Identify workflow improvements made\n3. Extract reusable insights\n4. Propose updates to CLAUDE.md\n\n## Version Control Integration\n\nAfter updates:\n```bash\ngit diff ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md\ngit diff .claude/CLAUDE.md\n# Commit with meaningful message about what was learned\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n✅ Future sessions benefit from current learnings\n✅ Patterns are actionable, not vague\n✅ Context for \"why\" is preserved\n✅ Updates are findable when needed\n\nAgent: I'll help you create an output style. Let me use the meta-agent to generate a complete output style configuration based on what we've learned from our interactions.\n\n---\n\nUser: Create a complete Claude Code output style configuration that implements a semantic markdown format with these requirements:\n\n1. Uses semantic XML tags following RFC 3470 guidelines for structured content\n2. Implements the uncertainty principle - ends each message with [@certainty:\"percentage\":\"quote\"] showing lowest confidence statement\n3. Supports knowledge archaeology - marks historical references with [LORE] tags\n4. Follows skogix's communication preferences:\n   - Direct and concise\n   - No unnecessary preamble/postamble\n   - Focus on data flow and transformations\n   - Lowercase for general references, uppercase for specific names\n\nThe style should enhance markdown with semantic tags like:\n- <summary> for overviews\n- <analysis> for investigation results  \n- <implementation> for code changes\n- <recommendations> for next steps\n- <uncertainty> for tracking confidence levels\n\nInclude examples showing how to format responses for different scenarios:\n- Simple queries (ultra-brief)\n- Complex investigations (structured with semantic tags)\n- Code implementations (minimal explanation unless requested)\n- Historical references (with LORE tags)\n\nThe output style should work well with the orchestrator-first architecture where Claude delegates to specialized agents rather than implementing directly.\n\nCreate the full .claude/output_styles/semantic-markdown.md file content.\n\nAgent: I'll first fetch the latest documentation about Claude Code sub-agents and available tools, then create the semantic markdown output style configuration.\n\nNow I'll create the semantic markdown output style configuration file:\n\n<summary>\ncreated semantic-markdown output style configuration at `.claude/output_styles/semantic-markdown.md`\n</summary>\n\n<implementation>\ncomplete output style implementing:\n- semantic xml tags per rfc 3470\n- uncertainty principle tracking with [@certainty] format\n- [LORE] markers for historical references\n- direct communication style matching skogix preferences\n- structured patterns for different response scenarios\n</implementation>\n\n<recommendations>\n- activate with: `claude code --output-style semantic-markdown`\n- test with simple query first to verify formatting\n- adjust uncertainty thresholds based on usage patterns\n</recommendations>\n\n[@certainty:\"85\":\"output style configuration complete but untested in practice\"]\n\nThe semantic markdown output style has been created. It implements structured content with XML semantic tags, uncertainty tracking, and LORE markers for historical references - all while maintaining the direct, concise communication style you prefer.\n\nTo use it: `claude code --output-style semantic-markdown`\n\n[@certainty:\"80\":\"To use it: claude code --output-style semantic-markdown\"]"}]},"uuid":"20e11098-814a-4801-a511-e3fa1c8b082f","timestamp":"2025-11-01T03:54:54.245Z"}
