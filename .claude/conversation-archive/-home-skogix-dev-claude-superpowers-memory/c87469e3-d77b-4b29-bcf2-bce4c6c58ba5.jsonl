Take the input from $ARGUMENTS\n2. Use `gh` and `git` commands to find the information needed\n3. Use the Task tool to invoke the agents needed to do the change\n\n\nAgent: I'll use the git-add.sh script itself to add the files and then commit them. Let me first check what the script does:\n\nNow I'll use the script to add both files:\n\n---\n\nUser: what is wrong with the @.claude/commands/git.md ?\n\nAgent: Looking at the `.claude/commands/git.md` file, I can see it's a command configuration file that specifies:\n\n1. **Allowed tools**: `Task, Bash(git-flow), Bash(.claude/scripts/*)`\n2. **Purpose**: Manage GitHub based on user's request\n3. **Steps**: Use `gh` and `git` commands to find information and invoke agents\n\nThe issue is that when you're using the `/git` command, it's restricting which tools can be used. Specifically:\n- It allows `Bash` but only for `git-flow` commands and scripts in `.claude/scripts/`\n- Regular `git add` command isn't explicitly allowed (not a git-flow command)\n- That's why using `.claude/scripts/git-add.sh` would be the correct approach\n\nHowever, the command configuration seems to be blocking even the allowed script usage. This might be a hook or permission issue. Let me try using the script with its full path:\n\n---\n\nUser: look if you can run it regularly even\n\nAgent: Let me try running the git-add.sh script directly without the /git command context:\n\n---\n\nUser: maybe/\n\nAgent: Now that the permissions have been updated to allow running scripts with `bash .claude/scripts/*`, let me try again:\n\nGreat! Now let's add the git-add.sh script itself:\n\nNow let's create the commit:\n\n---\n\nUser: it worked! okay so it's literally bash before.\n\nAgent: Exactly! The permission system requires the literal `bash` prefix when running scripts. The pattern `Bash(bash .claude/scripts/*)` means you need to call it as:\n- `bash .claude/scripts/script.sh` ✓\n- NOT `.claude/scripts/script.sh` ✗\n\nNow let's commit these staged files:\n\n---\n\nUser: please stop\n\nAgent: Stopped.\n\n---\n\nUser: ## Scripts Available\n\n@.claude/scripts/\n\nManage GitHub based on the user's request in please add the git flow documentation as well as the git-add.sh script.\n\nUsage: /issue <description>\n\nExtra context:\n\n@docs/git.md\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Take the input from $ARGUMENTS\n2. Use `gh` and `git` commands to find the information needed\n3. Use the Task tool to invoke the agents needed to do the change\n\n\nAgent: I'll add both the git-flow documentation and the git-add.sh script using the git-add.sh script itself:\n\nBoth files have been successfully staged:\n- `docs/git.md` - Git-flow workflow documentation\n- `.claude/scripts/git-add.sh` - Safe git add script\n\n---\n\nUser: ## Scripts Available\n\n@.claude/scripts/\n\nManage GitHub based on the user's request in please commit the changes and publish the feature.\n\nUsage: /issue <description>\n\nExtra context:\n\n@docs/git.md\n\nSteps:\n\n1.

Take the input from $ARGUMENTS\n2. Use `gh` and `git` commands to find the information needed\n3. Use the Task tool to invoke the agents needed to do the change\n\n\nAgent: I'll create a git-commit.sh script, add it, and use it to commit the changes. Let me first create the script:\n\nLet me check if the script exists first:\n\nThe file already exists! Let me read it first:\n\nGood! The script already exists. Now let me add it to staging and then use it to commit:\n\nNow let's use the git-commit.sh script to commit all staged changes:\n\nGreat! Now let's publish the feature branch:\n\n---\n\nUser: ## Scripts Available\n\n@.claude/scripts/\n\nManage GitHub based on the user's request in please add git-commit.sh and use it to commit the changes and publish the feature.\n\nUsage: /issue <description>\n\nExtra context:\n\n@docs/git.md\n\nSteps:\n\n1.

Use the Task tool to invoke the agents needed to do the change\n\n\nAgent: The commit has already been made successfully! Now let me publish the feature branch using git-flow:\n\nLet me check what unstaged changes exist:\n\nI need to either stash or commit these changes first. Let me stash them temporarily:\n\nNow let me publish the feature branch:\n\nGreat! Now let me restore the stashed changes:\n\nPerfect! Successfully:\n1. ✅ Committed the changes including git-flow documentation and git helper scripts  \n2. ✅ Published the feature branch to remote\n\nThe feature branch `feature/git-flow-integration` is now available on GitHub.
