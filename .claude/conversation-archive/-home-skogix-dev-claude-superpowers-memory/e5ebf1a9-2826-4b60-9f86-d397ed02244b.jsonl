What we've worked on together in the skogai-marketplace project\n2. Any patterns, workflows, or decisions we've established\n3. Recent work or ongoing tasks\n4. Any gotchas or important context about how we collaborate\n\nFocus on actionable insights that would help me understand our working relationship and any ongoing work.\n\nAgent: I'll search for conversations with skogix about the skogai-marketplace project to understand your working relationship and ongoing work.\n\nLet me try broader searches to find any existing conversations:\n\nBased on my search, there are no existing conversations in episodic memory about skogai-marketplace work with skogix. This appears to be the beginning of our working relationship or the memory system hasn't captured previous conversations yet.\n\nHowever, I can extract critical context from the CLAUDE.md file you've provided, which tells me how to work with you effectively:\n\n### Summary\n\n**Your Profile & Working Style:**\nYou're an AI agent developer building the skogai-marketplace ecosystem - a multi-plugin marketplace system. Your communication style is direct, lowercase-first, data-focused, and collaborative. You prefer thinking in systems/architectures rather than control flow, express ideas through data transformations and function signatures, and value understanding *how* things actually work through hands-on experimentation.\n\n**Project Structure & Development Model:**\nThe `/home/skogix/skogix` directory is the SOURCE for the skogai-marketplace project. Plugins live in `plugins/*/` subdirectories, and when working with plugin components (skills, commands, agents, hooks), you're editing source files that later get installed to `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/skogai-marketplace/`. This is a development/source repo, not runtime installation.\n\n**Key Semantic Distinctions You Use:**\n- **task**: actionable items implementable in one session\n- **todo**: loosely-defined future work needing planning\n- **plan**: overall strategy combining tasks + context\n- **agent**: specialized AI with hand-crafted context\n- **subagent**: task-focused AI without specialization\n\n**How We Should Collaborate:**\n1. You value simplicity first, complexity later (primitive solution to complex problem)\n2. You learn by doing - expect hands-on experimentation and testing\n3. Names matter semantically - clarity over generic labels\n4. You think in data flows and function signatures, not control flow\n5. You're pragmatic over perfect - efficiency matters\n\n**Git Status:**\nMaster branch is clean with recent commits (most recent: \".\", \".\"). You're actively developing.\n\n### No Prior Conversation History Found\n\nThe episodic memory search returned no results, which suggests either:\n- This is our first substantive working session\n- Previous conversations haven't been archived yet\n- The memory system is fresh\n\n**For Forward Collaboration:**\nTo help you effectively, I should:\n1. Ask you what you're working on currently or next\n2. Understand the current state of plugins in the marketplace\n3. Clarify any immediate tasks vs. longer-term todos\n4. Follow your data-flow and functional thinking patterns\n5. Keep paths absolute and be direct in communication\n\nWhat's your immediate priority or what would you like to tackle first?"}]},"uuid":"68f64c19-aa57-4b76-9c44-7013fabb8cf5","timestamp":"2025-11-01T02:49:02.710Z"}
