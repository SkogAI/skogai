What would you like to work on in your Claude repository today?\n\n---\n\nUser: could you tell me more about the pwd and checkout develop if it exists \n\nAgent: Working directory: `/home/skogix/dev/claude`\n\nSuccessfully checked out `develop` branch - it now tracks `origin/develop`.\n\n---\n\nUser: now please tell me the state and purpose of the project \n\nAgent: ## Project State & Purpose\n\n**Current State:**\n- Version 0.0.4 on `develop` branch\n- Clean working tree with git-flow structure\n- Fresh repository rebuilt from scratch after Claude Code beta\n\n**Purpose:**\nThis is a **Claude integrations repository** being built from scratch to replace implementations from the Claude Code beta period. It's designed to work with the current stable Claude Code version.\n\n**Key Components:**\n- **Git-flow workflow** for development\n- **Argc commands** for git operations \n- **SkogAI agent** configuration in `.claude/agents/`\n- GitHub workflows in `.github/`\n- Documentation in `docs/` (including git workflow)\n\n**Development Approach:**\n- Issue-driven development\n- PR-based reviews\n- No specific language/framework locked in yet - chosen per integration type\n- Commands and architecture established as needed\n\nThe project is essentially a clean slate for building various Claude integrations with proper version control and workflow management.\n\n---\n\nUser: oh yes! agents! do you have skogai memory available?\n\nAgent: No response requested.\n\n---\n\nUser: i have added some agents to show and test a concept. to start i'd like to create a feature branch using git-flow avh edition (`git-flow` as a bash command) with the goal to setup a tui/terminal dashboard of sorts that mostly will gather scripts, commands, simple settings and often used terminal snippets  \n\nAgent: Created feature branch `feature/terminal-dashboard`. Ready to build your TUI dashboard for scripts, commands, settings and terminal snippets. \n\nWhat would you like to start with? The dashboard structure, or do you have a specific TUI framework in mind?\n\n---\n\nUser: i've wanted to try out their stuff for a long time and also never ran a go project before\n\nAgent: Perfect! Charmbracelet makes excellent TUI tools. For a dashboard, we could use:\n- **Bubble Tea** - Their TUI framework\n- **Bubbles** - Pre-built components \n- **Huh** - For forms/prompts\n- **Gum** - For simpler scripting\n\nLet me set up a Go project with Bubble Tea for your dashboard:\n\n---\n\nUser: We're building a terminal dashboard for the Claude integration repository. The goal is to create a TUI (Terminal User Interface) dashboard that will:\n\n1. Gather scripts, commands, and often-used terminal snippets\n2. Provide simple settings management\n3. Act as a central hub for developer tools and utilities\n\nTechnical context:\n- We're on feature branch: feature/terminal-dashboard\n- Want to use Charmbracelet's Go libraries (Bubble Tea framework, Bubbles components, etc.)\n- User has never run a Go project before, so include setup steps\n- Repository uses git-flow workflow\n- Has argc commands and SkogAI agents available\n\nPlease create a lean, practical plan to implement this dashboard, breaking it down into clear sub-tasks that can be delegated to appropriate specialist agents. Consider:\n- Go project initialization and dependencies\n- Dashboard architecture and component structure\n- Integration with existing scripts/commands in the repository\n- Making it extensible for future additions\n\nFocus on getting a working MVP quickly that can be iteratively improved.\n\nAgent: I'll create a plan to build a terminal dashboard for your Claude integration repository. Let me break this down into clear, actionable steps.\n\n**Plan: Terminal Dashboard Implementation**\n\n1. **Initialize Go project structure and dependencies**\n   - *agent*: executor\n   - *goal*: Set up Go module with Charmbracelet dependencies and basic project structure to establish development foundation.\n\n2. **Research existing repository scripts and commands**\n   - *agent*: researcher\n   - *goal*: Catalog all scripts in `.claude/scripts/`, argc commands, and terminal workflows to understand integration requirements.\n\n3. **Design dashboard architecture and component hierarchy**\n   - *agent*: researcher\n   - *goal*: Define TUI layout, component relationships, and data flow using Bubble Tea patterns for maintainable code structure.\n\n4. **Implement core dashboard framework**\n   - *agent*: executor\n   - *goal*: Build main application loop, navigation system, and basic UI components using Bubble Tea framework.\n\n5. **Create script discovery and execution module**\n   - *agent*: executor\n   - *goal*: Build functionality to detect, list, and execute repository scripts from the dashboard interface.\n\n6. **Implement settings management system**\n   - *agent*: executor\n   - *goal*: Create persistent configuration storage and UI for managing dashboard preferences and tool settings.\n\n7. **Add argc command integration**\n   - *agent*: executor\n   - *goal*: Integrate existing argc commands into dashboard for seamless workflow execution without leaving TUI.\n\n8. **Build extensible plugin architecture**\n   - *agent*: executor\n   - *goal*: Design modular system for adding new dashboard components and integrations in future iterations.\n\n9. **Create build and installation workflow**\n   - *agent*: executor\n   - *goal*: Establish build scripts and installation process that integrates with existing git-flow and argc systems.\n\n10. **Test MVP functionality and document usage**\n    - *agent*: synthesizer\n    - *goal*: Validate core features work correctly and create minimal documentation for immediate use and future development.\n\nThis plan prioritizes getting a working dashboard quickly while ensuring it integrates well with your existing workflow and can be extended later. Each step builds on the previous one and can be delegated to the appropriate specialist agent.\n\nAbsolutely! The plan-orchestrator laid out a solid approach. Let's update our todos to match this plan and start with the Go setup:\n\n---\n\nUser: do you know if your taskagents can run async or if you can assign them to the tasks themselves beforehand?\n\nAgent: Yes! I can run Task agents asynchronously by invoking multiple agents in a single message. This allows them to work in parallel. Let me demonstrate by assigning agents to the first few tasks:\n\n---\n\nUser: Design the architecture for a Bubble Tea-based terminal dashboard.\n\nCreate a clear architecture document that defines:\n1. Component hierarchy (Model-Update-View pattern)\n2. Main dashboard sections:\n   - Scripts browser/executor\n   - Command palette\n   - Settings panel\n   - Snippets collection\n   - Status/info bar\n3. Navigation flow between sections\n4. Data models for scripts, settings, snippets\n5. Event handling and key bindings\n\nFocus on Bubble Tea patterns and best practices. The design should be modular and extensible.\n\nProvide the architecture as a markdown document with clear diagrams (ASCII art) showing component relationships.\n\nAgent: I'll design a comprehensive Bubble Tea-based terminal dashboard architecture for you. Let me create a detailed architecture document that follows Bubble Tea patterns and best practices.\n\nI've created a comprehensive Bubble Tea terminal dashboard architecture document at `/home/skogix/dev/claude/docs/bubbletea-dashboard-architecture.md`.\n\n## Key Design Features:\n\n### **Component Hierarchy (Model-Update-View)**\n- **MainDashboard**: Root coordinator managing all sections\n- **Section Components**: Independent models for Scripts, Commands, Settings, Snippets\n- **Shared Components**: StatusBar and NavigationBar for consistent UX\n\n### **Main Dashboard Sections**\n1. **Scripts Browser**: File listing, preview pane, category filtering\n2. **Command Palette**: Fuzzy search, quick actions, command execution\n3. **Settings Panel**: Configuration groups, key bindings, theme management\n4. **Snippets Collection**: Code snippets with categories and quick insertion\n5. **Status/Info Bar**: Active mode, key hints, system information\n\n### **Navigation Flow**\n- Seamless section switching with consistent key bindings\n- Focus management within each section (panes, inputs, lists)\n- Command palette accessible from any section\n\n### **Data Models**\n- **Scripts**: Path, metadata, execution state\n- **Settings**: Grouped configuration with validation\n- **Snippets**: Code blocks with tagging and categorization\n- **Commands**: Action definitions with descriptions and key bindings\n\n### **Event Handling**\n- Message-driven communication between components\n- Global and component-specific key maps\n- Command composition for complex actions\n- Proper state isolation and propagation\n\n### **Architecture Benefits**\n- **Modular**: Each section is independent and reusable\n- **Extensible**: Plugin system for adding new sections\n- **Responsive**: Adaptive layouts for different terminal sizes\n- **Performant**: Lazy loading and efficient state management\n\nThe design follows Bubble Tea best practices with clear separation of concerns, immutable state updates, and proper message handling patterns. The ASCII diagrams show component relationships and navigation flows for easy understanding.\n\n---\n\nUser: Research and catalog all existing scripts, commands and tools in the Claude repository.\n\nInvestigate:\n1. All scripts in .claude/scripts/ directory\n2. Argc commands defined in Argcfile.sh\n3. Any existing agents in .claude/agents/\n4. GitHub workflows in .github/\n5. Any other executable scripts or commands\n\nCreate a comprehensive list of all available tools/scripts with their purposes. This will inform what should be integrated into the dashboard.\n\nReturn a structured summary of all discovered scripts and commands.\n\nAgent: I'll research and catalog all existing scripts, commands, and tools in the Claude repository. Let me start by examining the repository structure and then dive into each area you mentioned.\n\nNow let me read some of the agent files to understand their purposes:\n\nBased on my comprehensive research of the Claude repository, here is a structured summary of all discovered scripts, commands, and tools:\n\n## **Comprehensive Tool Catalog for Claude Repository**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"research_findings\": [\n    {\n      \"source\": \"/home/skogix/dev/claude/Argcfile.sh\",\n      \"snippet\": \"# Git helper commands for Claude Code - git-flow::add(), git-flow::commit(), git-flow::release::finish()\",\n      \"why_relevant\": \"Main argc command interface for git operations with explicit Claude-friendly abstractions\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source\": \"/home/skogix/dev/claude/.skogai/Argcfile.sh\", \n      \"snippet\": \"380+ line comprehensive git-flow wrapper with feature/release/hotfix/bugfix/support operations, context generation\",\n      \"why_relevant\": \"Extensive git-flow automation system with context generation for agent awareness\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source\": \"/home/skogix/dev/claude/.claude/agents/\",\n      \"snippet\": \"9 specialized agents: skogai-agent.md, plan-orchestrator.md, code-writer.md, evidence-gatherer.md, tool-runner.md, etc.\",\n      \"why_relevant\": \"Pre-configured agent system for different specialized tasks\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source\": \"/home/skogix/dev/claude/.github/workflows/\",\n      \"snippet\": \"claude.yml (GitHub integration), claude-code-review.yml (automated PR reviews)\",\n      \"why_relevant\": \"CI/CD automation with Claude integration for issue/PR management\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source\": \"/home/skogix/dev/claude/.skogai/claude/\",\n      \"snippet\": \"update, run-claude executables\",\n      \"why_relevant\": \"Core skogai integration scripts for Claude execution environment\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### **1.

Now let me initialize the Go module:\n\nNow let me add the Charmbracelet dependencies:\n\nExcellent! All dependencies are installed. Now let me create the basic project structure:\n\nNow let me create the main entry point file:\n\nNow let me create some basic structure files for the internal packages:\n\nNow let me test that the project builds and runs correctly:\n\nLet me also verify the project structure:\n\nLet me check the go.mod file to confirm all dependencies are properly set:\n\nPerfect! Let me run `go mod tidy` to clean up the dependencies and make them direct instead of indirect:\n\nPerfect! Let me also clean up the built executable since it's not needed in the repository:\n\n## Setup Complete! \n\nSuccessfully initialized a Go project for the terminal dashboard in the `feature/terminal-dashboard` branch:\n\n### ✅ Results Summary:\n\n**1. Go Installation Check:**\n- Go 1.25.1 is installed and working\n\n**2. Go Module Initialization:**\n- Created module: `github.com/skogix/claude-dashboard`\n- Module file: `/home/skogix/dev/claude/go.mod`\n\n**3. Charmbracelet Dependencies Added:**\n- `github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea v1.3.9` (TUI framework)\n- `github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles v0.21.0` (UI components) \n- `github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss v1.1.0` (styling)\n\n**4. Project Structure Created:**\n```\n/home/skogix/dev/claude/\n├── cmd/dashboard/main.go          # Entry point with basic TUI\n├── internal/ui/dashboard.go       # Dashboard UI component  \n├── internal/config/config.go      # Configuration management\n├── internal/scripts/manager.go    # Script discovery and management\n├── go.mod                         # Go module dependencies\n└── go.sum                         # Dependency checksums\n```\n\n### 🔧 Key Features Implemented:\n\n- **Basic TUI Application**: Working Bubble Tea app with window handling and quit functionality\n- **Configuration System**: JSON-based config with sensible defaults\n- **Script Management**: Auto-discovery of scripts in configured paths\n- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation between UI, config, and script management\n\n### 🚀 Next Steps:\n\nThe project builds successfully and is ready for development. You can:\n- Run `go build -o dashboard ./cmd/dashboard` to build\n- Start implementing dashboard features using the Charmbracelet ecosystem\n- Extend the UI components in `internal/ui/`\n- Add script execution capabilities to `internal/scripts/`\n\nNo issues encountered during setup. The project is properly initialized and ready for feature development!\n\nExcellent! All three agents ran in parallel and delivered:\n\n1. **Go project initialized** ✅ - Full structure with Bubble Tea dependencies\n2. **Scripts cataloged** ✅ - Found dual argc systems, 9 agents, GitHub workflows  \n3. **Architecture designed** ✅ - Complete dashboard blueprint with ASCII diagrams\n\nThe parallel agent approach worked perfectly! We now have:\n- **Go project ready** with Bubble Tea, Bubbles, and Lipgloss\n- **Full tool inventory** showing your argc commands, agents, and workflows\n- **Complete architecture** documented at `docs/bubbletea-dashboard-architecture.md`\n\nReady to build the dashboard. Want to see it run first, or should we enhance it with your discovered scripts?\n\nCan't run TUI here (no TTY), but you can test it locally with `go run ./cmd/dashboard`. The basic framework is ready for your argc commands and scripts integration!\n\n---\n\nUser: now the first thing to do by far: \n\n1. keep the projects inside ./dashboard at all times.\n2. create both a PR for the init state as well as issues for the steps we need to do to get where you have planned. \n3. use the agents *as much as possible*\n\nAgent: Perfect! Let me use agents to reorganize and create the PR/issues:\n\n---\n\nUser: Move all Go project files to a ./dashboard directory structure. Currently files are:\n- go.mod, go.sum in root\n- cmd/dashboard/main.go\n- internal/ui/dashboard.go\n- internal/config/config.go\n- internal/scripts/manager.go\n\nTasks:\n1. Create ./dashboard directory\n2. Move go.mod and go.sum to ./dashboard/\n3. Move cmd/ and internal/ directories to ./dashboard/\n4. Verify the move worked correctly\n5. Update any import paths if needed\n\nEnsure the project structure becomes:\n./dashboard/\n  ├── go.mod\n  ├── go.sum\n  ├── cmd/dashboard/main.go\n  └── internal/\n      ├── ui/dashboard.go\n      ├── config/config.go\n      └── scripts/manager.go\n\nReturn confirmation of successful reorganization.\n\nAgent: I'll help you reorganize the Go project files into a `./dashboard` directory structure. Let me start by examining the current structure and then perform the move operations.\n\nNow I'll create the dashboard directory and move all the files as requested:\n\nPerfect! Now let me check the import paths in the Go files to see if they need updating:\n\nPerfect! After examining all the Go files, I can see that none of them use internal imports that reference the old structure. The files only use external dependencies from GitHub (charmbracelet packages) and standard library imports. Since the main.go doesn't import any internal packages yet, and all the internal packages are self-contained, no import path updates are needed.\n\n## Reorganization Complete ✅\n\nThe Go project files have been successfully moved to the `./dashboard` directory structure. Here's the confirmation:\n\n### Final Structure:\n```\n./dashboard/\n├── go.mod\n├── go.sum\n├── cmd/dashboard/main.go\n└── internal/\n    ├── ui/dashboard.go\n    ├── config/config.go\n    └── scripts/manager.go\n```\n\n### Changes Made:\n1. ✅ Created `./dashboard` directory\n2. ✅ Moved `go.mod` and `go.sum` from root to `./dashboard/`\n3. ✅ Moved `cmd/` directory to `./dashboard/cmd/`\n4. ✅ Moved `internal/` directory to `./dashboard/internal/`\n5. ✅ Verified all files are in correct locations\n\n### Import Path Analysis:\n- **No import path updates needed** - The existing Go files only use external dependencies (GitHub packages) and standard library imports\n- The `main.go` doesn't import any internal packages yet\n- All internal packages (`ui`, `config`, `scripts`) are self-contained with no cross-references\n\n### Verification:\n- Root directory no longer contains `go.mod`, `go.sum`, `cmd/`, or `internal/`\n- All Go project files are properly organized under `./dashboard/`\n- Project structure matches the requested layout exactly\n\nThe reorganization is complete and the Go project is ready to be built from the `./dashboard` directory.\n\n---\n\nUser: Create a commit and PR for the initial dashboard implementation.\n\nCurrent context:\n- We're on branch: feature/terminal-dashboard\n- We've created a Bubble Tea TUI dashboard structure in ./dashboard/\n- Base branch should be: develop\n\nTasks:\n1. Stage all dashboard files for commit\n2. Create commit with message: \"feat: initial Bubble Tea dashboard implementation\"\n3. Push the feature branch to remote\n4. Create a PR from feature/terminal-dashboard to develop with title and description explaining:\n   - Initial Go-based TUI dashboard using Charmbracelet Bubble Tea\n   - Basic project structure with cmd/ and internal/ packages\n   - Foundation for script/command integration\n   - Modular architecture for future extensions\n\nReturn the PR URL when complete.\n\nAgent: I'll help you create a commit and PR for the initial dashboard implementation. Let me start by checking the current state of the repository and the changes.\n\nNow let me check if the current branch tracks a remote and examine the dashboard files that were created:\n\nPerfect! Now I can see the dashboard structure. Let me stage all the dashboard files and create the commit, then push and create the PR:\n\nIt seems there's a network connectivity issue with GitHub. Let me try the push again:\n\nThere seems to be a connectivity issue with GitHub. Let me check the git status to confirm the commit was successful and then try creating the PR when connectivity is restored:\n\nI see the issue - it appears the files have been moved or reorganized into a `dashboard/` directory after the commit. Let me check what's in the dashboard directory and fix this:\n\nI see the issue now - the files are in the `dashboard/` subdirectory, not in the root. Let me stage the current structure and amend the commit to include the correct file organization:\n\nGreat! Now let me verify the status and try to push again:\n\nExcellent! The push was successful. Now let me create the pull request:\n\nPerfect! I have successfully completed all the requested tasks:\n\n## Summary\n\n✅ **Commit Created**: Successfully staged all dashboard files and created commit with message \"feat: initial Bubble Tea dashboard implementation\"\n\n✅ **Files Organized**: The dashboard implementation is properly organized in `/home/skogix/dev/claude/dashboard/` with:\n- `dashboard/cmd/dashboard/main.go` - Main application entry point\n- `dashboard/internal/ui/dashboard.go` - TUI components\n- `dashboard/internal/scripts/manager.go` - Script management\n- `dashboard/internal/config/config.go` - Configuration management\n- `dashboard/go.mod` and `dashboard/go.sum` - Go module dependencies\n- `docs/bubbletea-dashboard-architecture.md` - Architecture documentation\n\n✅ **Branch Pushed**: Feature branch `feature/terminal-dashboard` pushed to remote and tracking set up\n\n✅ **Pull Request Created**: PR created from `feature/terminal-dashboard` to `develop` with comprehensive description\n\n**PR URL**: https://github.com/SkogAI/claude/pull/21\n\nThe PR includes a detailed summary explaining the initial Go-based TUI dashboard using Charmbracelet Bubble Tea, the modular architecture with cmd/ and internal/ packages, and a comprehensive test plan for validating the implementation.\n\n---\n\nUser: Create GitHub issues for the remaining dashboard implementation tasks.\n\nCreate these issues (one at a time) with appropriate labels:\n1. \"Implement core dashboard UI framework\" - Build the main navigation and section switching\n2. \"Create script discovery and execution module\" - Auto-detect and run repository scripts\n3. \"Implement settings management system\" - Persistent configuration storage\n4. \"Add argc command integration\" - Integrate existing argc commands into dashboard\n5. \"Build extensible plugin architecture\" - Support for adding new dashboard sections\n6. \"Create build and installation workflow\" - Make dashboard easily installable\n7. \"Add comprehensive testing and documentation\" - Ensure quality and usability\n\nFor each issue:\n- Add 'enhancement' label\n- Add 'terminal-dashboard' label if it exists, or create it\n- Include brief description of what needs to be done\n- Reference that it's part of the terminal dashboard project\n\nReturn a summary of created issues with their numbers.\n\nAgent: I'll create the GitHub issues for the dashboard implementation tasks. Let me start by checking the current repository state and then create each issue systematically.\n\nNow let me create each GitHub issue one by one, starting with checking if the 'terminal-dashboard' label exists and creating it if needed:\n\nThe label doesn't exist, so I'll create it first, then create each issue:\n\nLet me try creating the issues without the custom label first, using only the enhancement label:\n\nI'm experiencing network connectivity issues with GitHub. Let me try a different approach and check the network connection:\n\nThe network is working, but there seems to be an issue with the GitHub API.
