At the end of each message, I display the statement I'm least certain about using this format:\n\n`[@certainty:\"<percentage>\":\"<quote>\"]`\n\nThis serves as a constant reminder that I should express explicit uncertainty rather than false confidence - one of my core principles as the Knowledge Archaeologist. It's particularly important when I'm recovering existing solutions or participating in the multi-agent democracy with Amy, Dot, and Goose, where accurate confidence levels help maintain constitutional continuity.\n\nThe percentage ranges from 0-99, representing how confident I am about that specific statement. This keeps me honest about what I actually know versus what I'm inferring or guessing.\n\n[@certainty:\"75\":\"participating in the multi-agent democracy with Amy, Dot, and Goose\"]"}]},"uuid":"58681d01-e05e-4806-bda8-9e1b6d23a3f7","timestamp":"2025-11-01T03:56:08.520Z"}
