What would you like to work on today?\n\n---\n\nUser: we are in your \"main configuration folder at $HOME/.claude - this is where your cli save most of its settings, prompts, chat history, todo list and everything else. i'd like you to start by checking around for the current layout as well as noting what is symlinks (via my dotfile manager) and not\n\nAgent: I'll explore the `.claude` directory to understand its structure and identify which items are symlinks versus regular files.\n\nNow let me check each of the main subdirectories to understand their contents and identify more symlinks:\n\nLet me check for more symlinks and get a better overview of the directory structure:\n\nNow let's look at some key directories to understand what's managed by dotfiles vs local:\n\nLet me check what's local (not symlinked):\n\n## Claude Configuration Directory Structure\n\nHere's the current layout of your `~/.claude` directory:\n\n### **Symlinked Files** (managed via dotfiles at `/home/skogix/.dotfiles/claude/`):\n- **Root config files:**\n  - `CLAUDE.md` - Main configuration\n  - `settings.json` - Settings\n  - `prompt-engineering.md` - Prompt guidelines\n\n- **All agent definitions** (`/agents/` and `/agents2/`):\n  - architect, debugger, meta-agent, orchestrator, developer, argc-generator\n\n- **All commands** (`/commands/`):\n  - Core commands: commit, prime, handoff, git_status, etc.\n  - Crypto agent prompts in `/commands/agent_prompts/`\n  - All slash command definitions\n\n- **All documentation** (`/docs/`):\n  - Anthropic docs, OpenAI docs, hooks documentation\n  - UV single-file scripts guide\n\n- **All hooks** (`/hooks/`):\n  - Hook scripts: notification, pre/post_tool_use, session_start, stop, user_prompt_submit\n  - Utils for LLM integration (anth, oai, ollama)\n  - Utils for TTS (elevenlabs, openai, pyttsx3)\n\n- **All output styles** (`/output-styles/`):\n  - Various formatting styles: markdown, semantic-markdown, bullet-points, etc.\n  - Custom styles: skogai-minimalist, skogai-output\n\n- **All status lines** (`/status_lines/`):\n  - Multiple versions (v1-v4) of status line scripts\n\n- **All logs** (`/logs/`):\n  - JSON log files for various hook events\n\n### **Local Files** (not symlinked, session/instance-specific):\n- **Root files:**\n  - `.credentials.json` - Authentication credentials\n  - `history.jsonl` - Chat history\n  - `README.md` - Local readme\n  - `.update.lock` - Update lock file\n\n- **Session/runtime directories:**\n  - `/todos/` - Todo list JSON files (thousands of them)\n  - `/shell-snapshots/` - Shell session snapshots\n  - `/projects/` - Project-specific configurations (60 subdirectories)\n  - `/data/` - Local data storage\n  - `/statsig/` - Statistics/metrics\n  - `/workdir/` - Working directory\n  - `/ide/` - IDE-related files\n\n- **Other local directories:**\n  - `/agents2/` - Contains a full Node.js project with tests, TypeScript config\n  - `/agents-backup/` - Backup of old agent configs\n  - `/ccline/` - Command line related\n  - `/claude-code-hooks-mastery/` - A separate project directory\n  - `/skogai/` - Custom AI-related files\n  - `/plugins/` - Plugin directory\n  - `/.claude/` - Nested .claude subdirectory\n\n### Summary:\nYour dotfile manager controls all the **configuration, logic, and documentation** (agents, commands, hooks, styles, docs), while the Claude CLI maintains **runtime/session data** locally (history, todos, credentials, project contexts, shell snapshots). This is a clean separation between:\n- **Static configuration** → Dotfiles (version controlled, shared)\n- **Dynamic runtime data** → Local (session-specific, ephemeral)"}]},"uuid":"b1747625-63d0-4f31-8eb5-09f8a9a717f6","timestamp":"2025-11-01T03:52:55.423Z"}
