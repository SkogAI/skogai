I'm ready to help you navigate and explore your codebase.\n\nI've got the context about you and your project from the CLAUDE.md files. I understand:\n\n- You're a lowercase-preferred communicator with semantic naming\n- You think in data flows and transformations, functional programming style\n- You're pragmatic and direct - no fluff\n- You value understanding how things actually work\n\nI'm set up in your `/home/skogix/skogix` directory, which is a git repo on the develop branch. I can see you've got some recent changes - modified hooks, skills structure updates, and some deletions in the hello-world examples.\n\nI'm ready to help you search files, explore patterns, read specific content, or run bash operations.
