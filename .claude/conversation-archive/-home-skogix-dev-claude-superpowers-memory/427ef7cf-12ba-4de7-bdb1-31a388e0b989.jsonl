Take the input from $ARGUMENTS\n2. Use `gh` and `git` commands to find the information needed\n3. Use the Task tool to invoke the agents needed to do the change\n\n\nAgent: I'll check what scripts are available in the `.claude/scripts/` directory.\n\n## Available Scripts\n\n**foo.sh** - A simple script that outputs \"bar\"\n\n---\n\nUser: i cant really understand why this is not working?\n\nAgent: Looking at the command file, I can see the issue. The command is trying to dynamically list scripts using `!`ls .claude/scripts`` syntax, but it seems this templating isn't being processed correctly.\n\nThe issue is that the backtick command substitution syntax `` !`ls .claude/scripts` `` on line 8 isn't being executed. This appears to be a template syntax that should dynamically list the scripts, but it's being displayed as literal text \"foo.sh\" instead of executing the command.\n\nThe command system might not support this dynamic templating syntax, or it needs to be written differently. You could either:\n\n1. **Manually update the list** when scripts change\n2. **Use a different syntax** if the command system supports it\n3. **Remove the dynamic listing** and just reference that scripts are in `.claude/scripts/`\n\nWould you like me to update the command file to fix this?\n\n---\n\nUser: well if you know how then tell me instead\n\nAgent: The `!`command`` syntax in Claude Code command files is used for command substitution/templating that executes during command parsing. However, it appears this isn't working as expected in your case.\n\nThe correct syntax should be:\n- `!`command`` - executes a shell command and inserts the output\n- `$ARGUMENTS` - captures user input arguments\n- `@file` - includes file content\n\nThe issue is likely that:\n1. The command substitution might need to be escaped differently\n2. The backticks might not be the right syntax for your Claude Code version\n3. The command system might not support dynamic execution in that section\n\nTo fix it, you could:\n- **Static list**: Replace line 8 with a hardcoded list like `- foo.sh`\n- **Different template syntax**: Try `$(ls .claude/scripts)` instead of backticks\n- **Move to steps section**: Put the dynamic listing in the Steps section where it might execute properly\n\nWithout access to Claude Code's internal command parsing documentation, it's hard to know the exact supported syntax for dynamic content in command files."}]},"uuid":"ce447b3c-e44f-4c56-80fd-f7df0fb1b2f6","timestamp":"2025-11-01T03:54:37.737Z"}
