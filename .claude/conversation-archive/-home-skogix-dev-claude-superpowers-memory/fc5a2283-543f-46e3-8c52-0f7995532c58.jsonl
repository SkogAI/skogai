You already have `UNDOTTED=\"bin\"` in your rcrc file (line 6). This means the `bin` folder won't get the dot prefix when symlinked.\n\nTo add more folders that shouldn't get the dot prefix, just add them to the `UNDOTTED` line separated by spaces:\n\n```bash\nUNDOTTED=\"bin folder1 folder2\"\n```\n\nThis way, `bin/`, `folder1/`, and `folder2/` will be symlinked as `~/bin/`, `~/folder1/`, and `~/folder2/` instead of `~/.bin/`, `~/.folder1/`, etc."}]},"uuid":"92d14bd7-62e7-4eb0-98ef-38ab595abc8b","timestamp":"2025-11-01T03:53:36.502Z"}
