What happened, what was built/discussed. Use <summary></summary> tags.\n\nUser: hello claude! i want to create a git-flow workflow which uses the `git-flow` program instead of having full access to gh and git. do this make sense?\n\nAgent: Yes, that makes perfect sense! Using the `git-flow` program provides a standardized, structured workflow with built-in commands that enforce consistent branching patterns. It's a good alternative to manually managing branches with raw git/gh commands.\n\nLet me check if git-flow is installed and set up a workflow for you.\n\nGreat! You have git-flow installed. Let me create a comprehensive git-flow workflow guide to replace your current git workflow.\n\n---\n\nUser: you do hopefully understand that you will have to use the git-flow program to create the feature branch and so on?\n\nAgent: Absolutely! Yes, I understand - I'll be using `git-flow` commands like:\n- `git flow feature start <name>` to create feature branches\n- `git flow feature finish <name>` to complete features\n- `git flow release start <version>` for releases\n- `git flow hotfix start <name>` for hotfixes\n\nNot raw `git branch` or `gh` commands. The git-flow tool handles all the branching, merging, and naming conventions automatically. Let me set this up properly.\n\nPerfect! Git-flow is already initialized. Let me update the documentation and mark the first task complete.\n\n---\n\nUser: please remove your todos....\n\nAgent: Done. Should I proceed with creating the git-flow workflow documentation?\n\n---\n\nUser: no, you can listen to me ok? your job is to keep @CLAUDE.md and other documentation updated as we go along first and foremost\n\nAgent: Understood! My primary job is to keep @CLAUDE.md and other documentation updated as we work. \n\nSo when we make changes like switching to git-flow workflow, I should update the documentation to reflect that. Should I update @CLAUDE.md now to reflect that we're using git-flow commands instead of direct git/gh access?\n\n---\n\nUser: now you see what i changed. our job now is to figure out what @docs/git.md should say as well as what exact tools do the agent and command need for git-flow usage\n\nAgent: I see! You've started a git-flow feature branch and modified the agent/command to use `git-flow` instead of direct git/gh access. Let me update the documentation to reflect this git-flow workflow.\n\nNow for the tools needed - the agent and command configurations should use:\n- `Bash(git-flow:*)` for all git-flow commands\n- `Bash(gh:*)` might still be needed for GitHub operations like creating PRs, managing issues\n\n---\n\nUser: no changes without reason behind it\n\nAgent: You're right! Let me think through what tools are actually needed:\n\nFor git-flow workflow:\n- `Bash(git-flow:*)` - for git-flow commands (feature start/finish, release, hotfix, etc.)\n- `Bash(gh:*)` - still needed for GitHub operations (creating PRs, managing issues, viewing PR comments)\n- `Bash(git:*)` - might still be needed for basic git operations (status, diff, log, commit, push)\n\nThe agent needs all three because:\n1. `git-flow` manages the branching workflow\n2. `gh` handles GitHub-specific tasks (PRs, issues)  \n3. Basic `git` for commits, status checks, diffs\n\nThe command file should have the same permissions since it's managing GitHub operations.\n\nShould I update both files to include all three: `Bash(git-flow:*),Bash(gh:*),Bash(git:*)`?\n\n---\n\nUser: no, you should add the actual commands needed for gh and git - then argue why\n\nAgent: You're absolutely right! Let me analyze what specific commands are actually needed:\n\nFor a git-flow workflow, the agent would need:\n\n**git-flow commands:**\n- `git flow feature/bugfix/hotfix/release start/finish/publish` - core workflow commands\n\n**gh commands needed:**\n- `gh pr create` - create pull requests after publishing features\n- `gh pr list/view` - check PR status\n- `gh issue create/list/view` - manage issues that drive features\n- `gh api` - for advanced GitHub operations like viewing PR comments\n\n**git commands needed:**\n- `git status` - check working directory state before starting/finishing features\n- `git diff` - review changes before commits\n- `git add` - stage changes\n- `git commit` - make commits within feature branches\n- `git log` - review commit history\n- `git push` - might be needed for non-flow pushes\n\nSo the tools should be:\n```\ntools: Bash(git-flow:*),Bash(gh:pr),Bash(gh:issue),Bash(gh:api),Bash(git:status),Bash(git:diff),Bash(git:add),Bash(git:commit),Bash(git:log),Bash(git:push)\n```\n\nThis is the minimal set needed because:\n- git-flow handles branch management but not commits/staging\n- gh is still required for GitHub integration (PRs, issues)\n- Basic git commands are needed for day-to-day work within branches\n\nDoes this reasoning make sense?\n\n---\n\nUser: now split them up again into \"read only\" and \"write / actions\"\n\nAgent: Good thinking! Let me categorize them:\n\n**Read-only commands (safe, informational):**\n- `git status` - check working directory state\n- `git diff` - review changes\n- `git log` - review commit history\n- `gh pr list` - list pull requests\n- `gh pr view` - view PR details\n- `gh issue list` - list issues\n- `gh issue view` - view issue details\n- `gh api` (when used for GET requests) - read GitHub data\n\n**Write/Action commands (modify state):**\n- `git-flow:*` - all git-flow commands create/merge/delete branches\n- `git add` - stage changes\n- `git commit` - create commits\n- `git push` - push to remote\n- `gh pr create` - create pull requests\n- `gh issue create` - create issues\n\nThis separation is useful because:\n- Read-only commands can be run freely without side effects\n- Write commands need more careful consideration\n- Some contexts might want read-only access (like status checking agents)\n- Others need full write access (like the main github-agent)\n\nShould we create separate permission sets for different use cases?\n\nExample: <summary>Implemented HID keyboard functionality for ESP32.
