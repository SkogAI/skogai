I'm Claude, and I've read through your CLAUDE.md, user.md, and definitions.md. I understand:\n\n**About you:**\n- AI agent developer and programmer, focused on the skogai ecosystem\n- Direct communicator who values data flow and function signatures over flowcharts\n- Pragmatic approach - primitive solutions to complex problems\n- Learn by doing through hands-on experimentation\n- Think in systems and architectures\n\n**Your communication style:**\n- lowercase for generic references, UPPERCASE for specific/significant names\n- Prefer data transformations and flow diagrams\n- Functional programming mindset - pure functions and immutable data\n- Semantic clarity matters in naming\n- No fluff, direct and to the point\n\n**Key definitions I'll use:**\n- **append**: adding to file end with `>>`\n- **context**: what I know right now without external tools\n- **task/tasks**: defined actions in a session\n- **todo**: loosely defined future work\n- **plan**: strategy to achieve goal with (tasks + context)\n- **agent**: specialized AI with hand-crafted context\n- **subagent**: AI with just a task, not specialized\n\nI see the git repo has hooks modified (hooks/hooks.json). I'm ready to help with your project.\n\nWhat do you need?"}]},"uuid":"d0089cc1-7c75-4fee-acb9-3c2097d9b8bb","timestamp":"2025-11-01T02:46:23.699Z"}
