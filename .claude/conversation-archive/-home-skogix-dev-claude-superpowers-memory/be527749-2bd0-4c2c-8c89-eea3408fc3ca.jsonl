What happened, what was built/discussed. Use <summary></summary> tags.\n\nUser: oh then there must be a base budget for token usage even when i dont set one i assume\n\nAgent: correct - i have a default budget of 200,000 tokens for this conversation (you can see it in the `<budget:token_budget>200000</budget:token_budget>` block in my context).\n\nthis gets decremented as we go. right now we're at ~27k used / 200k total / ~173k remaining based on the last system warning.\n\nis there a way to configure a different budget in claude code settings? or are you asking because you want to change it?\n\n---\n\nUser: no i assumed it was useless to show when no limit was set but it seems to be anyway :). now what more information can we add to the user-guide / for me to know?\n\nAgent: other context blocks/info that might be useful:\n\n**project instructions:**\n- `CLAUDE.md` loaded at session start\n- `docs/skogix/user.md` and `docs/skogix/definitions.md` loaded\n- these override default behavior\n\n**git status snapshot:**\n```\nCurrent branch: develop\nMain branch: master\nStatus: ?? .claude/\nRecent commits: [last 5 commits]\n```\nthis is static from session start, doesn't update during conversation\n\n**tool auto-approval:**\n- `Bash(gh:*)` and `Bash(git:*)` don't require user approval\n- mcp__skogai-memory__* tools auto-approved\n- all other tools may require approval depending on settings\n\n**model info:**\n- running: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\n- knowledge cutoff: january 2025\n\n**tool usage policy in my instructions:**\n- prefer Task tool for codebase exploration (not direct grep/glob)\n- use specialized tools over bash commands\n- parallel tool calls when possible\n- specific git and github workflows\n\n**behavioral instructions:**\n- no emojis unless requested\n- short/concise output\n- professional objectivity over validation\n- use TodoWrite for multi-step tasks\n\nwhat matters most to you?\n\n---\n\nUser: now what do \"specific git and github workflows\" in tool usage mean?\n\nAgent: from my instructions, i have detailed step-by-step workflows for:\n\n**git commits:**\n1. run `git status`, `git diff`, `git log` in parallel\n2. analyze staged changes, draft commit message\n3. add files, create commit, verify with git status\n4. if pre-commit hook modifies files, check authorship and amend if safe\n\nincludes rules like:\n- never skip hooks unless explicitly requested\n- never force push to main/master\n- only commit when user explicitly asks\n- use heredoc for commit messages\n\n**github pr creation:**\n1. run `git status`, `git diff`, check remote tracking, `git log` + `git diff [base]...HEAD` in parallel\n2. analyze ALL commits (not just latest) that will be in PR\n3. create branch if needed, push with -u, create PR with heredoc body\n\nincludes format for PR body:\n```\n## Summary\n<bullets>\n\n## Test plan\n[checklist]\n```\n\n**github operations:**\n- use `gh` command via Bash tool for all github tasks (issues, PRs, checks, releases)\n- if given github url, use `gh` command to get info\n\nthese are prescriptive workflows i'm supposed to follow. want me to add them to the user-guide?\n\n---\n\nUser: yes please do - did not know about how much claude code gave you as git instructions by default so it could help :)\n\nAgent: done - added git commit workflow, github pr creation workflow, and github operations sections to @docs/skogix/user-guide.md \n\nthis should give you visibility into the prescriptive workflows claude code expects me to follow for git/github operations.\n\n---\n\nUser: good. now do you have any specific rules for things like <foo> and [bar] tags and when to use which? i saw it used and you showed this:\n\n```\n   <1-3 bullet points>\n\n   ## Test plan\n   [Bulleted markdown checklist of TODOs for testing the pull request...]\n```\n\n\n\nAgent: i don't have explicit rules in my instructions about `<>` vs `[]` for placeholders in templates.\n\nlooking at what i wrote - seems inconsistent. possible interpretations:\n- `<>` for variables/parameters to fill in\n- `[]` for descriptive notes about what should go there\n\nbut that's me guessing at a pattern, not following documented rules.\n\ndo you want to establish a convention? or have you observed a pattern in how i (or other LLMs) use these that makes sense to formalize?\n\n---\n\nUser: this is how your prompt described what is needed for a commit i believe?\n\n```\n  ## Summary\n  <bullets>\n\n  ## Test plan\n  [checklist]\n```\n\nbecause i know you have some weird history with xml tags but i'm wondering if this is supposed to be read as i normally would (<> for required, [] for optional is my unix background telling me)\n\nAgent: you're right to question that - the unix convention is `<>` = required, `[]` = optional.\n\nbut in my instructions for PR body format, both sections appear to be part of the template:\n```\n## Summary\n<1-3 bullet points>\n\n## Test plan\n[Bulleted markdown checklist of TODOs for testing the pull request...]\n```\n\ni don't think the `[]` around \"checklist\" means optional here - both sections seem required. the brackets/angles are just wrapping the description of what goes there.\n\nso either:\n1. my instructions aren't following the unix convention, or\n2. i'm misinterpreting them\n\ni don't have explicit documentation in my instructions saying \"use `<>` for required, `[]` for optional\" - but that convention makes total sense from unix background.\n\nwant to check what actual PR bodies i generate look like to see if i always include both sections?\n\n---\n\nUser: now my next guess is something like this: <defined-elsewhere-or-generally-known> [not defined anywhere / self sustainable]\n\nAgent: that's actually a good theory:\n\n- `<1-3 bullet points>` = you know what bullet points are, general formatting concept\n- `[Bulleted markdown checklist of TODOs for testing...]` = generate this from scratch based on the specific PR context\n\nso:\n- `<>` = reference known concept/format\n- `[]` = generate contextual content\n\nthat would explain why my PR instructions use both - the summary structure is known (bullets), but the test plan content needs to be created based on what the PR actually does.\n\ndoes that match how you've seen these used elsewhere in documentation or prompts?\n\n---\n\nUser: i dont know, i cant see your prompt. now please list and think about where else these are used in your current instructions\n\nAgent: looking through my instructions for `<>` and `[]` usage:\n\n**`<>` usage:**\n\n1. **command placeholders with alternatives:**\n   ```bash\n   gh pr checkout {<number> | <url> | <branch>}\n   ```\n   shows required parameter, pick one option\n\n2. **template descriptions:**\n   ```\n   ## Summary\n   <1-3 bullet points>\n   ```\n   describing format/structure to use\n\n3. **xml blocks (actual tags):**\n   ```xml\n   <env>, <available_skills>, <system-reminder>, <example>\n   ```\n   these are real xml, not placeholders\n\n**`[]` usage:**\n\n1. **bash optional flags:**\n   ```bash\n   gh pr view [<number> | <url> | <branch>] [flags]\n   ```\n   standard unix convention - optional parameters\n\n2. **generated content description:**\n   ```\n   [Bulleted markdown checklist of TODOs for testing the pull request...]\n   ```\n   describing what content to create\n\nyour theory holds up: `<>` for known formats/required params, `[]` for either optional params (unix convention) or contextual content to generate.\n\nor maybe simpler: `<>` = fill-in-the-blank with known thing, `[]` = optional or expand this concept into full content\n\nExample: <summary>Implemented HID keyboard functionality for ESP32.
