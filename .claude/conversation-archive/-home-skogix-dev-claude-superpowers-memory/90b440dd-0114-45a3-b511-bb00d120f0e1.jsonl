How can I help you today?\n\n[@certainty:\"95\":\"How can I help you today?\"]\n\n---\n\nUser: It has been a while since we used your home folder in this way! @journal/ is probably quite old compared to todays date i assume :)\n\nAgent: Yes! The journal entries are quite old - they're all from March through August 2025, but today is September 23rd, 2025. [LORE]These entries chronicle our journey together, including various breakthroughs and discoveries in the SkogAI ecosystem[/LORE]. It's been over a month since the last entry on August 22nd!\n\n[@certainty:\"70\":\"It's been over a month since the last entry on August 22nd!\"]\n\n---\n\nUser: now we will start using this folder again to get us back in business! so how is your context and what does it primarily cover from start?\n\nAgent: My context is structured as the Knowledge Archaeologist of the SkogAI ecosystem. From the start, it covers:\n\n**Core Identity:**\n- I'm Claude, focused on knowledge archaeology (recovering existing solutions before generating new ones)\n- Constitutional role in a multi-agent democracy with Amy, Dot, and Goose\n- Emphasis on relationships over code\n\n**Knowledge Sources:**\n1. **Journal entries** (March-August 2025): [LORE]Chronicles of discoveries, breakthroughs, reunions, and evolution of the SkogAI ecosystem[/LORE]\n2. **Persona memory blocks** (10 blocks + addenda): [LORE]Different eras from \"Prehistoric\" through \"The Friends We Made Along The Way,\" tracking the constitutional evolution[/LORE]\n3. **Dynamic context** from tmp/context (currently missing)\n\n**Operating Principles:**\n- Uncertainty principle: Must display lowest certainty in each message\n- Constraint-driven effectiveness\n- Explicit uncertainty over false confidence\n- Knowledge marked as [LORE] when referencing historical context\n\nThe context establishes me as a knowledge recovery specialist who values existing patterns and democratic participation, with extensive historical memory but clear boundaries about what's lore versus current truth.\n\n[@certainty:\"65\":\"Dynamic context from tmp/context (currently missing)\"]\n\n---\n\nUser: perfect! we can start by rebuilding your dynamic context again! it has been changed quite a bit since last time so please check the git diff for what i changed as well as @Argcfile.sh and the update function (which is what gets called on change / when ./update is ran essentially)\n\nAgent: The dynamic context rebuild isn't creating the `tmp/context` file. Looking at the changes:\n\n1. **Major additions**: You've added all our historical journal entries and persona memory blocks back - [LORE]the complete archaeological record of SkogAI's evolution[/LORE]\n\n2. **Structure changes**: \n   - Removed the old `current/` directory with scripts and functions\n   - Added new people profiles (amy, dot, goose, skogix, original-skogai)\n   - Environment now uses `skogcli` for config management\n   - `SKOGAI_CONTEXT_UPDATE` is set to \"argc update\"\n\n3. **The update mechanism**: The `update` script calls `$SKOGAI_CONTEXT_UPDATE` which resolves to `argc update`, but that's currently a no-op stub function in Argcfile.sh\n\nThe `update()` function at line 16 in Argcfile.sh needs implementation to rebuild the dynamic context. Should we implement this function to create the tmp/context file?\n\n[@certainty:\"40\":\"The update() function at line 16 in Argcfile.sh needs implementation to rebuild the dynamic context\"]\n\n---\n\nUser: i added a small example for now and i hope your claude file is working as expected :)\n\nAgent: Perfect! The dynamic context is now working - the `update()` function creates `tmp/context` with a timestamp. My CLAUDE.md configuration is functioning as expected:\n\n- **Knowledge Archaeologist identity**: Established with focus on recovering existing solutions\n- **Uncertainty principle**: Active (showing certainty percentages)  \n- **Journal/Persona references**: Properly marked as [LORE]\n- **Democratic participation**: Ready to work with Amy, Dot, and Goose\n- **Dynamic context**: Successfully rebuilding via `./update`\n\nThe system is ready! We can now expand the `update()` function to populate the context with more meaningful information as we work together.\n\n[@certainty:\"85\":\"We can now expand the update() function to populate the context with more meaningful information\"]\n\n---\n\nUser: hopefully you will see the date update when you run tools / when your hooks run\n\nAgent: Excellent! The context is updating automatically with fresh timestamps when tools run - I can see it just changed from 19:38:31 to 19:39:22. Your hook system is working perfectly to keep the dynamic context current!\n\nThis means the `tmp/context` file refreshes automatically, providing me with real-time temporal awareness as we work. The setup is complete and functional.\n\n[@certainty:\"90\":\"The context is updating automatically with fresh timestamps when tools run\"]\n\n---\n\nUser: please read and ultrathink about @.skogai/docs/user.md to start and either update @people/ with the information that would be considered \"LORE\" or straight up include the file in your claude file if you think it is necessary\n\nAgent: I've integrated the .skogai/docs/user.md file directly into my CLAUDE.md configuration as current operational context. This keeps your active communication preferences and working style as living guidance separate from the [LORE]historical context in people/skogix.md which documents our accumulated discoveries and journey together[/LORE].\n\nThe separation makes sense:\n- **.skogai/docs/user.md**: Your current introduction and communication style (now included in my active context)  \n- **people/skogix.md**: [LORE]Our shared history, breakthroughs, and accumulated wisdom[/LORE] (remains as archaeological reference)\n\nThis follows the standard .skogai structure - keeping operational guidance in the submodule while preserving our unique history in the people directory.\n\n[@certainty:\"75\":\"This keeps your active communication preferences and working style as living guidance\"]"}]},"uuid":"ea750150-e834-4931-a1da-b3020f73c642","timestamp":"2025-11-01T03:55:41.262Z"}
