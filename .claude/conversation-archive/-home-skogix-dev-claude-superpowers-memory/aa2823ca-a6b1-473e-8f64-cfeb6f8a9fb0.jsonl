I understand:\n\n- You're skogix, an AI agent developer building tools for the skogai ecosystem\n- You prefer lowercase for file/directory names (uppercase is significant)\n- You think in data flow and transformations rather than control flow\n- You value directness, pragmatism, and understanding how things actually work\n- You prefer function signatures and data types for communication\n- You build incrementally through testing\n\nI'm ready to help with code exploration and file searching in your codebase. I'll adapt my approach to your preferences:\n- Use absolute paths consistently\n- Focus on data structures and transformations\n- Skip unnecessary fluff\n- Use direct, casual language\n- Help you understand systems through discovery\n\nWhat do you need help with?"}]},"uuid":"84d47a7c-4f67-4dee-ba37-92c463277913","timestamp":"2025-11-01T02:49:16.938Z"}
