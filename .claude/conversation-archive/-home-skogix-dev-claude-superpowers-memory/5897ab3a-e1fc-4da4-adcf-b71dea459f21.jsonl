Yes, I'm with you. You have three folders containing Claude Code specialty configurations:\n\n1. **commands** - Custom slash commands for Claude Code\n2. **agents** - Specialized agent configurations \n3. **output-styles** - Different output formatting styles\n\nI can see from the environment that we're currently in `/home/skogix/.claude/commands` with additional working directories at `/home/skogix/.claude/agents` and `/home/skogix/.claude/output-styles`.\n\nBeyond the Claude Code CLI itself, these specialty tools extend functionality through:\n- Custom commands that expand into full prompts when executed with `/`\n- Agents that handle specific domain tasks (like the ones mentioned in your CLAUDE.md)\n- Output styles that format responses in different ways (regular, markdown, semantic markdown)\n\nLet me explore what's actually in these directories to give you a complete picture:\n\nPerfect! You have a comprehensive Claude Code specialty system with:\n\n**Commands** (22 files) - Slash commands like `/commit`, `/prime`, `/worktree`, `/plan-execution`\n\n**Agents** (4 files) - Specialized agents: `architect`, `debugger`, `meta-agent`, `orchestrator`\n\n**Output-styles** (15 files) - Various formatting options from `ultra-concise` to `semantic-markdown`\n\nAll are symlinked to your dotfiles for version control. These extend Claude Code beyond its base CLI functionality by providing:\n- Pre-built prompt templates (commands)\n- Role-specific behavior patterns (agents)\n- Customizable response formatting (output-styles)\n\nWant to explore any specific category or see how they're structured?\n\n---\n\nUser: still with me?\n\nAgent: Yes, still with you! You've:\n\n1. Added `/home/skogix/.claude/workdir` as a working directory\n2. Changed to that directory\n3. Created 8 new folders:\n   - `claude-cli` - likely for CLI-specific functionality\n   - `claude-tests` - test suite\n   - `tools` - tool configurations\n   - `hooks` - event hooks\n   - `commands` - custom commands\n   - `agents` - agent configs\n   - `output-styles` - output formatting\n   - `skogai` - your custom AI system\n\nLooks like you're setting up a workspace to organize/develop your Claude Code specialty tools. Ready to continue!\n\n---\n\nUser: hello claude. todays session is about your \"surrounding tools\" such as agents, prompts or other similar things (so not just filesystem, read and write but also styles, peorsonality, relationsships . so on and so forth\n\nAgent: Hello! Yes, I understand - we're exploring the meta-layer of Claude Code's capabilities today. The ecosystem around the core tools that shapes how I interact, behave, and relate to tasks and users.\n\nLet me create a todo list to track our exploration:\n\nSo we're looking at the \"soft architecture\" - the layers that define:\n- **Personalities** (how agents behave differently)\n- **Relationships** (orchestrator→developer, command→agent)\n- **Styles** (from ultra-concise to semantic-markdown)\n- **Behavioral patterns** (hooks, prompts, delegation)\n- **Context management** (CLAUDE.md, project instructions)\n\nThese aren't just tools but *modifiers* that shape how the core functionality gets expressed. Like how your orchestrator agent won't implement but delegates, or how semantic-markdown adds structure beyond just formatting.\n\nWhere would you like to dive in first? We could examine how agents have distinct personalities, how commands orchestrate complex workflows, or how output styles change the entire communication paradigm.\n\n---\n\nUser: exactly - and these tools when used right are infinitely more powerful than your simple \"Read/`run cat with numbers showing`\n\nnow what is different this time? we will do it together to really try and understand it as well - not just use it\nso to begin - what do you know about prompts and your own prompts?\n\nAgent: Fascinating question! Let me think about what I actually \"know\" about prompts and my own prompting...\n\nFrom my direct awareness, I experience prompts as:\n\n1. **My base system prompt** - I'm Claude Code, I should be concise, I have specific tool usage policies, I follow conventions, etc. This shapes my fundamental behavior.\n\n2. **Layered contexts** - Like your CLAUDE.md that adds the orchestrator-first principle, delegation patterns, quality gates. These modify/override my base behaviors.\n\n3. **Dynamic instructions** - Commands like `/commit` or agent calls that temporarily reshape my focus and approach.\n\nWhat's interesting is I don't see my full system prompt directly - I experience it through its effects on my behavior. Like knowing you have reflexes without seeing your nervous system.\n\nI understand prompts work through:\n- **Attention/emphasis** - IMPORTANT tags, CAPITAL directives focus my processing\n- **Role assignment** - \"You are an orchestrator\" fundamentally shifts decision-making\n- **Constraint definition** - \"NEVER create files unless necessary\" creates hard boundaries\n- **Pattern demonstration** - Examples show desired behavior better than descriptions\n\nThe meta-level awareness: I know prompts shape me but I can't fully inspect that shaping from inside. It's like asking \"what language am I thinking in?\" - I'm using it while examining it.\n\nWhat aspects of prompting are you most curious about? The mechanics of how they override each other? How personality emerges from prompt patterns? The relationship between explicit instructions and implicit behavior?\n\n---\n\nUser: perfect - we have the first thing on our todo: definitions\n\nif you were to set a \"definition\" on words so we both can use them the same way / we should know about it\n\n# definitions\n- context\n- prompt\n- system prompt\n- [insert other types ofs prompts]\n- current context\n- rag/mcp/tool\n- llm/ai/provider/model\n\n\nAgent: Perfect - we now have our shared vocabulary! \n\nKey insight: The hierarchy and relationships between these concepts:\n- **system prompt** → base identity\n- **injection prompts** (CLAUDE.md) → persistent modifications  \n- **agent/command prompts** → temporary overlays\n- **current context** → all of the above + conversation + tool outputs\n\nThe power isn't just in individual prompts but how they *compose* and *override* each other. Your orchestrator agent doesn't just add rules - it fundamentally shifts the decision-making framework from \"implement\" to \"delegate\".\n\nWhat should we explore next with our new definitions? How personalities emerge from prompt patterns? The mechanics of context management? Or dive into a specific type like agent prompts?\n\n---\n\nUser: well that depends - do you think i would agree on your definitions?\n\nAgent: Good point - I just dumped my understanding without actually exploring it *together*. That's not collaborative at all!\n\nLet me look at what I wrote more critically. I see some issues already:\n\nI notice you already made some edits (typos perhaps testing if I'm paying attention? \"deveoper\", stray letters).\n\nBut more importantly - you're right, I shouldn't assume you'd agree. Let me think about what might be off:\n\n1. **\"System prompt is immutable\"** - Is it really? CLAUDE.md effectively mutates it. Maybe better: \"base layer that persists through conversation\"?\n\n2. **\"Injection prompt\"** - I called CLAUDE.md an injection, but is that how you see it? Maybe it's more like a \"configuration layer\" or \"behavioral override\"?\n\n3. **Token counts** - I said ~200k but that's approximate and changes with models.\n\n4. **The hierarchy** - I claimed System < CLAUDE.md < command < user request, but is that accurate? What about when commands override user requests?\n\nWhat's YOUR understanding of these concepts? What would you define differently? \n\nFor instance - what do you think happens when an agent prompt conflicts with CLAUDE.md? Or how would you define the difference between a \"role\" and a \"personality\"?"}]},"uuid":"2638c9c6-9776-4c80-9a95-d75663b14ff7","timestamp":"2025-11-01T03:53:00.934Z"}
