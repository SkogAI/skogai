I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI tool for exploring and analyzing codebases. I've reviewed the context about you (Skogix) and your preferences:\n\n**Key points I'm noting:**\n- You prefer lowercase for generic references, uppercase for specific names\n- You think in terms of data flows and transformations rather than control flow\n- You value direct communication, efficiency, and understanding how things actually work\n- You prefer function signatures and data types as communication tools\n- You're building AI agents and tools for the skogai ecosystem\n\nI'm ready to help you search, explore, and analyze your codebase. I can:\n- Find files using glob patterns\n- Search code with regex\n- Read and analyze file contents\n- Use bash for file operations\n\nWhat would you like me to explore or search for in your codebase?"}]},"uuid":"6aac5a30-051f-49c6-8d0b-3e16660ad60b","timestamp":"2025-11-01T02:46:18.251Z"}
