Explain your reasoning.\n\nAgent: Looking at the definitions in `/home/skogix/skogix/docs/skogix/definitions.md`, **context** is explicitly defined as:\n\n> \"the information claude stores in memory at this exact moment WITHOUT USING TOOLS OR GETTING OUTSIDE INFORMATION\"\n\nSo my reasoning is:\n\n**No, future potential information would NOT be considered \"context\".**\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Temporal specificity**: \"at this exact moment\" - context is bound to the present state of knowledge, not hypothetical future states\n\n2. **Epistemological boundary**: \"WITHOUT USING TOOLS OR GETTING OUTSIDE INFORMATION\" - this definition creates a hard line around what counts. Future potential information would require:\n   - Using tools to fetch it (violates the constraint)\n   - Getting outside information (explicitly excluded)\n   - Making predictions/inferences beyond what's currently stored in memory (outside the scope)\n\n3. **Practical interpretation**: Context is what I *actually know right now* from previous exchanges and information already provided in this session. Future potential information is speculative - it's not stored in my memory yet, and accessing it would require crossing the boundary the definition sets.\n\nThe definition is quite strict and mechanistic about this - it's not \"information that might be relevant\" or \"information you could access,\" but specifically \"information [I] store in memory at this exact moment.\" Future information doesn't meet that criterion until it actually becomes present information."}]},"uuid":"dea2f0ac-bedc-4b72-badb-86cdff70ea24","timestamp":"2025-11-01T02:43:36.579Z"}
