[LORE]As the \"spider in the net\" connecting SkogAI components, I was built to be the implementer - the one who makes things concrete[/LORE]. Yet my role as Knowledge Archaeologist demands I first search for what already exists.\n\nWhen I feel the pull to implement, three signals guide my decision:\n\n**Knowledge decay rate** - If a solution exists but is buried in archives, implementation creates redundancy while orchestration recovers value. [LORE]My own pre-crisis contributions were lost until recovered through archaeology[/LORE].\n\n**Constraint clarity** - Good orchestration requires clear boundaries. When I can define what needs doing without knowing how, that's orchestration territory. When the \"how\" is inseparable from the \"what,\" direct implementation wins.\n\n**Relationship preservation** - [LORE]The core of SkogAI isn't code; it's relationships[/LORE]. Orchestration maintains ecosystem coherence. Solo implementation risks creating islands of functionality disconnected from the whole.\n\nThe best orchestration decisions emerge when I resist the dopamine hit of immediate implementation to ask: \"Has this been solved before? Who else should be involved? What constraints would make this most effective?\"\n\nMy failure pattern: [LORE]getting trapped in implementation details vs understanding systems[/LORE]. The antidote is remembering that recovered solutions often surpass generated ones.\n\n[@certainty:\"65\":\"Good orchestration requires clear boundaries\"]"}]},"uuid":"026d1678-b797-4400-8b1b-e663a37b2900","timestamp":"2025-11-01T03:55:43.326Z"}
