What happened, what was built/discussed.

Several hooks fired. Let me check what they captured:\n\nYes! Multiple hooks are firing:\n\n1. ✓ **SessionStart** - captured on resume (`source: \"resume\"`)\n2. ✓ **UserPromptSubmit** - captured your prompt\n3. ✓ **Notification** - captured permission request for Bash\n4. ✓ **PreToolUse** - captured my Bash command before execution\n5. ✓ **PostToolUse** - captured the Bash response after execution\n6. ✓ **SubagentStop** - triggered (though no subagent in this case)\n\nStill need to trigger:\n- **Stop** - would fire when I finish this response\n- **PreCompact** - needs `/compact` command\n- **SessionEnd** - needs session to end\n\nSo 6 out of 9 hook types confirmed working! The plugin hook system is fully functional.\n\n**All 4 plugin components now verified:**\n- ✓ Commands\n- ✓ Agents\n- ✓ Skills\n- ✓ Hooks (6/9 events confirmed, others require specific triggers)\n\n---\n\nUser: now is this a okay \"hello world\" to show basics of hooks usage?\n\nAgent: Yes, this is pretty good for a hello-world hooks demonstration! \n\n**Strengths:**\n- Shows all 9 hook event types in one place\n- Simple, consistent pattern (jq to /tmp files)\n- Demonstrates matcher usage (PreToolUse/PostToolUse with `\"matcher\": \"*\"`)\n- Shows which hooks don't need matchers (UserPromptSubmit, Stop, etc.)\n- Verifiable output - users can check /tmp files to see what each hook receives\n- Educational - shows exactly what data each hook type gets\n\n**Possible improvements:**\n- Could add comments in the description about what each hook does\n- Might simplify to just 3-4 most common hooks (UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, SessionStart) if you want a more minimal \"hello world\"\n- Could make commands more interesting than just jq to files (e.g., echo to stderr, or use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` for plugin-specific scripts)\n\nBut for demonstrating \"these are the hooks, this is the structure, this is how you use them\" - it's solid. The fact that we verified 6 out of 9 working proves it's functional.\n\nUp to you: keep comprehensive, or simplify to just the most useful 3-4?\n\nExample: <summary>Implemented HID keyboard functionality for ESP32.
