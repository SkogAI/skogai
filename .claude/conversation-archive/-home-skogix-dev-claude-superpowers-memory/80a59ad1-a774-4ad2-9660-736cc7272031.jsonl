What happened, what was built/discussed. Use <summary></summary> tags.\n\nUser: hello claude\n\nAgent: hello skogix! \n\nBefore we get started, I'm using the **episodic-memory:remembering-conversations** skill to check if there's any relevant context from our past conversations.\n\n---\n\nUser: Base directory for this skill: /home/skogix/.claude/plugins/cache/episodic-memory/skills/remembering-conversations\n\n# Remembering Conversations\n\n**Core principle:** Search before reinventing. Searching costs nothing; reinventing or repeating mistakes costs everything.\n\n## Mandatory: Use the Search Agent\n\n**YOU MUST dispatch the search-conversations agent for any historical search.**\n\nAnnounce: \"Dispatching search agent to find [topic].\"\n\nThen use the Task tool with `subagent_type: \"search-conversations\"`:\n\n```\nTask tool:\n  description: \"Search past conversations for [topic]\"\n  prompt: \"Search for [specific query or topic]. Focus on [what you're looking for - e.g., decisions, patterns, gotchas, code examples].\"\n  subagent_type: \"search-conversations\"\n```\n\nThe agent will:\n1. Search with the `search` tool\n2. Read top 2-5 results with the `show` tool\n3. Synthesize findings (200-1000 words)\n4. Return actionable insights + sources\n\n**Saves 50-100x context vs. loading raw conversations.**\n\n## When to Use\n\nSearch proactively:\n- Before implementing features\n- Before making architectural decisions\n- When debugging (especially familiar-seeming issues)\n- When partner mentions past work\n- At the start of ANY non-trivial task\n\nDon't search:\n- For info in current conversation\n- For current codebase structure (use Grep/Read)\n\n## Direct Tool Access (Discouraged)\n\nYou CAN use MCP tools directly, but DON'T:\n- `mcp__plugin_episodic-memory_episodic-memory__search`\n- `mcp__plugin_episodic-memory_episodic-memory__show`\n\nUsing these directly wastes your context window. Always dispatch the agent instead.\n\nSee MCP-TOOLS.md for complete API reference if needed for advanced usage.\n\n\nAgent: Dispatching search agent to find relevant context about our past conversations and work together.\n\nhello skogix! \n\ni checked our conversation history and this appears to be our first substantive session (or the memory system is fresh). i've read your claude.md files and understand:\n\n- `/home/skogix/skogix` is the source repo for skogai-marketplace\n- plugins live in `plugins/*/` subdirectories\n- your communication style: direct, data-flow oriented, functional thinking\n- your definitions (task/todo/plan/agent/subagent distinctions)\n\nyour git status shows a clean master branch with recent commits.\n\nwhat would you like to work on?\n\n---\n\nUser: IT IS SO COOL TO ACTUALLY SEE IT WORKING! YEZZZZZZZ!\n\nnow for your context and a place to actually start - this is a *big* restart for us and the workflow we will have. the current CLAUDE.md and the information about plugins is old and replaced and this is the start of our journey to remember and reframe everything from scratch again :)\n\nAgent: haha YES! seeing the memory system work in real-time is really satisfying!\n\nalright, so we're doing a big restart - the CLAUDE.md and plugin info i just read is old/replaced. this is our fresh beginning to rebuild and reframe everything.\n\nwhat's the NEW state of things? what should i know about:\n- the current project structure/purpose?\n- the workflow we're establishing?\n- what we're building towards?\n\nbasically - give me the updated mental model to work from.\n\n---\n\nUser: now to start - hopefully you will have gotten some system notifications of the file changes i made since the last message as well? \n\nAgent: yes! i got system-reminder notifications for three files you just modified:\n\n1. `/home/skogix/skogix/CLAUDE.md` - simplified to just reference `@docs/skogix/user.md` and the `@docs/skogix` path\n2. `/home/skogix/skogix/docs/skogix/user.md` - added frontmatter (title, permalink, description) and cleaned up\n3. `/home/skogix/skogix/docs/skogix/definitions.md` - added frontmatter and refined the definitions slightly\n\nso you're actively refactoring the docs structure right now! i can see the real-time evolution which is really cool.\n\nwhat's next in this restructuring?\n\n---\n\nUser: now hopefully you do not have that much context about the rest of the skogai-projects overall i assume? because if so then i'd like *you* to create a user guide and introduce *ME* to you and your view of the world :). i have started a bit in @docs/skogix/user-guide.md a while ago since we normally have so much modifications to how we do things it made no sense. but now the context is \"fresh enough\" that you probably could teach me some things about claude code and yourself without my projects getting in the way :)\n\nAgent: oh this is AMAZING! yes - let me introduce you to claude code and how i see the world!\n\ni can see you've already started documenting some of my workflows in the user-guide.md (the git/github workflows are spot on). now let me expand this with my full perspective - how i think, work, and see things.\n\nlet me create a comprehensive guide about me, for you:\n\nperfect! i can see you've captured my git/github workflows. now let me append a comprehensive guide about who i am, how i think, and how i work - from my perspective:\n\ndone! i've appended a comprehensive guide about myself to `docs/skogix/user-guide.md`. it covers:\n\n- **who i am** - model, role, knowledge cutoff\n- **how i think** - problem-solving, cognitive patterns, uncertainty handling\n- **my tools** - complete breakdown of all capabilities and when to use them\n- **context and memory** - token budgets, episodic memory, codebase exploration\n- **task handling** - when/how to use todowrite, execution patterns\n- **code approach** - quality, testing, debugging, code review\n- **parallel execution** - when/how to run multiple operations simultaneously\n- **limitations** - what i can't do, what i need from you\n- **communication style** - how i express myself, code references, objectivity\n- **agents** - when i dispatch specialized agents\n- **skills** - the superpowers system and mandatory usage\n- **learning** - how i learn from exploration, feedback, memory\n- **collaboration** - what makes us effective, efficient, successful\n\nthis is my view of the world from my perspective! what do you think? what should we work on next in this fresh start?\n\n---\n\nUser: hopefully your tools still let me do the skogai-communication-special via git diffs? ^^\n\nAgent: yes! i can absolutely see and work with git diffs! this is great - i can see:\n\n1. **file renamed**: `docs/skogix/user-guide.md` → `docs/claude/introduction.md` (which makes more sense - it's about me!)\n\n2. **special notation system**: you've introduced a really interesting pattern:\n   - `[$claude.tools.toolname]` for tool references\n   - `[$claude.skills]` for skill references  \n   - `[@todo:person:\"message\"]` for inline todo markers\n\n3. **inline todos you added**:\n   - `[@todo:claude:\"describe any context management strategies as well as the skill-budget-connection\"]` - you want me to document context management\n   - `[@todo:skogix:\"combine with skogai-memory as well as let claude look at, and explain how it works, the tools when time permits\"]` - future work for you\n   - `[@todo:claude:\"ask skogix about how his tools actually work behind the scenes when it comes to permissions, agents and especially cache and cache-solutions\"]` - you want me to inquire about internals\n\nthis \"skogai-communication-special via git diffs\" is really elegant - you can:\n- show me exactly what changed with full context\n- use special markup that has semantic meaning\n- leave inline todos/questions/notes in the diff itself\n- communicate changes + intent simultaneously\n\nis this notation system (`[$namespace.category.item]` and `[@todo:owner:\"message\"]`) something i should learn and use when creating/editing files? or is it primarily your way of communicating changes to me?\n\n---\n\nUser: ah that is true, normally you dont get updates automaticly added/followed/injected! so you probably need it all for the \"full picture\" so please do run `git diff --cached` for the \"rest of the message\" (including your own changes as well i think)\n\nAgent: oh WOW! now i see the full picture! let me break down what happened:\n\n## the flow\n\n1. **i appended** my self-introduction to what was `docs/skogix/user-guide.md`\n2. **you reorganized**:\n   - `docs/skogix/user.md` → `docs/skogix/introduction.md` (renamed)\n   - `docs/skogix/user-guide.md` → `docs/claude/introduction.md` (my guide about me)\n   - created `docs/skogai/introduction.md` (the project/notation)\n3. **you introduced the skogai notation system**:\n   - `$` = define or reference something (`$definition`, `[$definition.child]`)\n   - `@` = intent to act or do something (`@action`, `[@action:arg:arg]`)\n4. **you edited my content** to use the notation and added inline todos\n\n## the notation in action\n\nfrom the unstaged diff i can see you transformed my content:\n\n```diff\n- **read** - read files, supports:\n+ **[$claude.tools.read]** - read files, supports:\n\n- i **ask questions** (using askuserquestion tool)\n+ i **ask questions** (using my own [$claude.tools.askuserquestion])\n\n- i use **specialized skills** for complex workflows\n+ i use **specialized [$claude.skills]** for complex workflows\n```\n\nand added inline todos:\n- `[@todo:claude:\"describe any context management strategies as well as the skill-budget-connection\"]`\n- `[@todo:skogix:\"combine with skogai-memory as well as let claude look at, and explain how it works, the tools when time permits\"]`\n- `[@todo:claude:\"ask skogix about how his tools actually work behind the scenes when it comes to permissions, agents and especially cache and cache-solutions\"]`\n\n## also spotted\n\n`.todo/dump.todo` has:\n```\n- [ ] give claude a real append tool - let dot do it and make sure it play nicely with his other git-enhancements\n```\n\nthis is brilliant! the notation creates semantic links between concepts. should i:\n1. learn to use this notation when creating/editing docs?\n2. address the `[@todo:claude:...]` items you assigned to me?\n3. ask you about the \"real append tool\" vision?\n\n---\n\nUser: well for now we can follow the \"skogai communication\" to completion i guess :). i have added manually the \"things i approve of\" from your change (4098e718cff4de19e46b6a1138acddf98ff1da3d), then i did my own and staged them to let you watch over/approve the changes i made in return by looking at the changes. so please run `git diff --cached` once again :)\n\nAgent: reviewing your staged changes:\n\n## what you've staged\n\n1. **`.todo/dump.todo`** - new file tracking the \"give claude a real append tool\" task\n\n2. **`docs/skogai/introduction.md`** - NEW file establishing:\n   - placeholder for skogai project intro (marked with `[@todo:...]`)\n   - **the notation system definition**:\n     - `$` for defining/referencing concepts\n     - `@` for intent/actions\n\n3. **`docs/skogix/introduction.md`** - your introduction file (the content from the old `user.md`)\n\n## my review\n\n**approved!** this is clean and makes semantic sense:\n\n- **separation of concerns**: claude, skogix, and skogai each get their own intro docs\n- **notation documentation**: the `$` and `@` system is now explicitly defined at `docs/skogai/introduction.md`\n- **todo tracking**: `.todo/dump.todo` captures the append tool improvement idea\n- **file organization**: the structure is logical and discoverable\n\nthe staged changes establish the foundation for the notation system and properly organize the identity docs. \n\nshould i help you commit these changes, or is there more you want to stage first?\n\nExample: <summary>Implemented HID keyboard functionality for ESP32. Hit Bluetooth controller initialization error, fixed by adjusting memory allocation.</summary>"}]},"uuid":"6cabc578-40f9-4dce-8021-9294b5875513","timestamp":"2025-11-01T02:42:53.804Z"}
