Restart Claude Code to apply changes.</local-command-stdout>\n\nAgent: No response requested.\n\n---\n\nUser: any hello-worlders out there?\n\nAgent: I don't see \"hello world\" in my context. The hook executed successfully (system reminder confirms it), but the stdout from `/tmp/hello.sh` still isn't appearing anywhere I can see.\n\nShould I be looking somewhere specific, or is this confirming that the stdout injection feature described in the docs doesn't actually work?\n\n---\n\nUser: and test 2!\n\nAgent: Still nothing. Hook runs successfully but I don't see \"hello world\" anywhere in my context.\n\nThe stdout injection feature from the docs isn't working (or doesn't exist despite what the docs say).\n\n---\n\nUser: and now how i think they work\n\nAgent: Waiting to see what happens with this new hook...\n\n---\n\nUser: something?\n\nAgent: I don't see any output from the hook in my context. The hook ran successfully (system reminder confirms it), but whatever stdout it produced isn't visible to me.\n\nStill no evidence of the stdout injection feature working despite what the docs claim should happen.\n\n---\n\nUser: now obviously a pure echo was stupid so my bad :P\n\nAgent: Ah! Now you're capturing the actual JSON input that the hook receives via stdin and writing it to a file. That's way smarter than just echoing.\n\nLet me check what the hook captured:\n\nThe file shows `null` - that's because UserPromptSubmit hooks don't have a `tool_input` field. According to the docs, UserPromptSubmit receives fields like `prompt`, `session_id`, `hook_event_name`, etc.\n\nTry changing the jq to just `.` to capture everything?\n\n---\n\nUser: goddamit, now then :P\n\nAgent: Perfect! Now let me check what the hook actually captured:\n\nExcellent! Now I can see exactly what the UserPromptSubmit hook receives:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"session_id\": \"28f5000c-f830-40f6-896c-b7b85fab3b92\",\n  \"transcript_path\": \"/home/skogix/.claude/projects/-home-skogix-skogix/28f5000c-f830-40f6-896c-b7b85fab3b92.jsonl\",\n  \"cwd\": \"/home/skogix/skogix\",\n  \"permission_mode\": \"default\",\n  \"hook_event_name\": \"UserPromptSubmit\",\n  \"prompt\": \"goddamit, now then :P\"\n}\n```\n\nPerfect! The hook is definitely working - it receives the proper JSON input via stdin with all the fields the docs describe. This confirms the hook component is functional.\n\nSo all 4 plugin components are now confirmed working:\n- ✓ Commands\n- ✓ Agents\n- ✓ Skills  \n- ✓ Hooks (receiving input and executing successfully)\n\n---\n\nUser: now we want to essentially append \"\\n and hello world\" to the prompt field as our @hooks/hooks.json \n\nAgent: I'll create a script that outputs the proper JSON to inject additional context:\n\nExample: <summary>Implemented HID keyboard functionality for ESP32. Hit Bluetooth controller initialization error, fixed by adjusting memory allocation.</summary>"}]},"uuid":"0b8012c1-acc3-45ea-b823-ec7361967f16","timestamp":"2025-11-01T02:42:27.030Z"}
