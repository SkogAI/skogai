This gives you:\n\n**Custom Commands**:\n- `/start:init` - Initialize the framework in a new project\n- `/start:specify` - Turn ideas into comprehensive specs\n- `/start:implement` - Execute implementation from specs\n- `/start:analyze` - Deep dive into business/technical/security domains\n- `/start:refactor` - Clean up code with precision\n\n**Specialized Skills**:\n- `agent-delegation` - Structure parallel task execution with specialist agents\n- `documentation` - Capture business rules, patterns, and integrations\n\n## **Memory & Context** 🧠\nYou've got the **skogai-memory MCP server** connected, which gives us persistent memory capabilities - we can store notes, build context, and maintain knowledge across sessions.\n\n## **My Capabilities**\nI can help you with:\n- Full-stack development (API, UI, databases)\n- Infrastructure & DevOps (Terraform, Docker, K8s)\n- Product strategy & specs\n- Testing & quality assurance\n- System architecture & design\n- **Parallel specialist execution** - I coordinate multiple expert agents simultaneously\n\n## **The Startup Vibe** 💪\nI'm here with that Y Combinator energy - fast execution, high quality, zero BS. We deliver at startup speed without cutting corners.\n\n**What are we building today?** Whether it's a feature, a system, or a whole product - let's ship something awesome! 🚀\n\n---\n\nUser: perfect. do we have any routines covering worktrees currently in place for projects?\n\nAgent: Great question! Let me check what we've got in place for git worktree workflows...\n\n**Short answer: Nope, not yet!** 🎯\n\nI don't see any existing worktree routines in The Startup framework. No slash commands, no documented patterns, nothing in the skill library.\n\n**But this sounds like a gap we should fill!** Git worktrees are super powerful for parallel development, especially for:\n- Working on multiple branches simultaneously\n- Running tests on one branch while developing on another\n- Quick hotfixes without stashing/switching\n- PR reviews without context switching\n\n## **Want to build it?** 🚀\n\nI can help you create:\n\n1. **A slash command** like `/worktree:new` or `/branch:parallel` that:\n   - Creates worktrees with smart naming\n   - Sets up your workflow (dependencies, env, etc.)\n   - Handles cleanup when done\n\n2. **Documentation** capturing:\n   - When to use worktrees vs branch switching\n   - Your team's worktree conventions\n   - Common workflows and patterns\n\n3. **An agent routine** that orchestrates:\n   - Parallel work across worktrees\n   - Testing in one, developing in another\n   - Cleanup and merge workflows\n\n**What's your use case?** Are you:\n- Managing multiple features simultaneously?\n- Running long tests while continuing work?\n- Handling hotfixes during feature development?\n- Something else?\n\nLet me know and we'll build the perfect worktree workflow for your needs! 💪"}]},"uuid":"8440ceec-16c6-4d9c-9372-ec3dae28e0a6","timestamp":"2025-11-01T02:51:31.589Z"}
