Look for the user's shell configuration files (like .bashrc, .zshrc, etc.) to understand their PS1 prompt setup, then configure the statusLine to match or complement their terminal prompt style and information display preferences.\n\nAgent: I'll help you configure the statusLine based on your shell PS1 configuration. Let me start by reading your shell configuration files to understand your current prompt setup.\n\nI can see you're using Oh My Zsh with the \"simple\" theme. Let me check what that theme looks like and also look for any custom PS1 configuration:\n\nNow let me check if you have existing Claude Code settings:\n\nPerfect! I can see your shell setup. You're using Oh My Zsh with the \"simple\" theme, which displays:\n- Current directory path (in green for regular users, red for root)\n- Git status information with branch name and clean/dirty indicators\n- Simple prompt ending with a space\n\nLet me create a statusLine configuration that matches your terminal style. I'll create a script that provides similar information but tailored for Claude Code:\n\n## StatusLine Configuration Complete\n\nI've successfully configured your Claude Code statusLine to match your shell prompt style. Here's what I've set up:\n\n### Configuration Details\n\n**File Updated:** `/home/skogix/.claude/settings.json`\n\n**StatusLine Features:**\n- **Directory Display:** Shows the current directory name (basename) in green, matching your zsh simple theme\n- **Git Integration:** \n  - Displays current branch name in parentheses\n  - Shows ✔ for clean repos and ✗ for dirty repos (matching your theme's git indicators)\n  - Only shows git info when in a git repository\n- **Model Display:** Shows the current Claude model in cyan brackets (e.g., `[Claude 3.5 Sonnet]`)\n- **Color Scheme:** Uses ANSI colors that will appear dimmed in the status line, maintaining readability\n\n### Example Output\nYour statusLine will display something like:\n- `claude (develop ✗) [Claude 3.5 Sonnet]` - when in a git repo with changes\n- `claude (master ✔) [Claude 3.5 Sonnet]` - when in a clean git repo  \n- `my-project [Claude 3.5 Sonnet]` - when not in a git repo\n\nThe configuration preserves your existing permissions settings and adds the statusLine functionality that complements your terminal prompt style.\n\n---\n\n**Important:** This statusline-setup agent must be used for any further status line changes. You can ask Claude to continue making modifications to the status line configuration as needed.\n\nYour statusLine has been configured to match your shell PS1 style! It now displays:\n- Current directory name in green\n- Git branch with status indicators (✔ for clean, ✗ for dirty) \n- Current Claude model in cyan brackets\n\nThe configuration file has been updated at `~/.claude/settings.json`."}]},"uuid":"accdea07-d88e-43e6-863a-13520c3c15d5","timestamp":"2025-11-01T03:56:26.593Z"}
