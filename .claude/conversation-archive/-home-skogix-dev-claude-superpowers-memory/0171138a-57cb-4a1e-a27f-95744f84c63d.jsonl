MCP servers are active. I can see the following MCP tools available:\n- `mcp__acp__read` - for reading files\n- `mcp__acp__write` - for writing files  \n- `mcp__acp__edit` - for editing files\n- `mcp__acp__multi-edit` - for multiple edits\n- `mcp__acp__Bash` - for running commands\n- `mcp__acp__BashOutput` - for checking background command output\n- `mcp__acp__KillBash` - for stopping background commands\n\nThe MCP server is working properly with your Zed editor setup.\n\n---\n\nUser: https://tools.skogai.se/\n this maybe works as well i hope!\n\n<context ref=\"https://tools.skogai.se/\">\n# MCP Bridge API    - POST /tools/:name    ```   curl -X POST http://localhost:8808/tools/filesystem_write_file  \\     -H 'content-type: application/json' \\     -d '{\"path\": \"/tmp/file1\", \"content\": \"hello world\"}'   ``` - GET /tools   ```   curl http://localhost:8808/tools   ```\n</context>\n\nAgent: I'll check if your MCP Bridge API at tools.skogai.se is accessible!\n\nExcellent! Your MCP Bridge API at tools.skogai.se is working! I can see you have three MCP servers running:\n\n1. **librarian-mcp** - File system operations, document management\n2. **tools-mcp** - Web search, command execution, utilities  \n3. **skogaimemory-mcp** - Memory management, project tracking, canvas visualization\n\nThese are accessible through the bridge API, giving you a comprehensive set of tools for various tasks. The bridge appears to be running on port 8808 and successfully exposing all the MCP server capabilities through a unified HTTP API."}]},"uuid":"457b4338-5e89-4d5e-95fd-34f13568f87f","timestamp":"2025-11-01T03:53:29.041Z"}
