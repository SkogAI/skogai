Provide a concise definition.\n\nAgent: In a general sense, **context** refers to the circumstances, environment, or background information that surrounds and gives meaning to something.\n\nIt's the collection of relevant facts, conditions, or details that help explain or clarify a particular situation, statement, or concept. Context answers questions like \"where,\" \"when,\" \"why,\" and \"what conditions apply,\" enabling proper understanding and interpretation.\n\nFor example, the word \"bank\" has different meanings depending on context: it could refer to a financial institution, the edge of a river, or tilting an aircraft. The surrounding information determines which interpretation is correct."}]},"uuid":"187198fc-9bf9-4b87-bbab-d8c4b494d6a6","timestamp":"2025-11-01T02:46:37.228Z"}
