I'll help you remake your Claude-related integrations from scratch. Since you're moving from the beta version to the current Claude Code setup, let's start fresh.\n\nWhat specific integrations would you like to set up? Some common ones include:\n- API integrations\n- CLI tools\n- Editor/IDE integrations\n- Workflow automations\n\nLet me know what you'd like to focus on first, and I'll help you build it properly with the current Claude Code version.\n\n---\n\nUser: Please analyze this codebase and create a CLAUDE.md file, which will be given to future instances of Claude Code to operate in this repository.\n\nWhat to add:\n1. Commands that will be commonly used, such as how to build, lint, and run tests. Include the necessary commands to develop in this codebase, such as how to run a single test.\n2. High-level code architecture and structure so that future instances can be productive more quickly. Focus on the \"big picture\" architecture that requires reading multiple files to understand.\n\nUsage notes:\n- If there's already a CLAUDE.md, suggest improvements to it.\n- When you make the initial CLAUDE.md, do not repeat yourself and do not include obvious instructions like \"Provide helpful error messages to users\", \"Write unit tests for all new utilities\", \"Never include sensitive information (API keys, tokens) in code or commits\".\n- Avoid listing every component or file structure that can be easily discovered.\n- Don't include generic development practices.\n- If there are Cursor rules (in .cursor/rules/ or .cursorrules) or Copilot rules (in .github/copilot-instructions.md), make sure to include the important parts.\n- If there is a README.md, make sure to include the important parts.\n- Do not make up information such as \"Common Development Tasks\", \"Tips for Development\", \"Support and Documentation\" unless this is expressly included in other files that you read.\n- Be sure to prefix the file with the following text:\n\n```\n# CLAUDE.md\n\nThis file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.\n```\n\nAgent: I'll analyze your codebase and create a CLAUDE.md file for future Claude instances working in this repository.\n\nIt appears this is a completely empty directory - you're truly starting from scratch! Let me create a basic CLAUDE.md file that will help future Claude instances understand this is a fresh project for Claude-related integrations.\n\nI've created a CLAUDE.md file for your fresh repository. Since this is an empty directory where you're starting your Claude integrations from scratch, the file provides context about:\n\n1. The repository's purpose (Claude-related integrations)\n2. The migration context (from beta to stable Claude Code)\n3. Your username for personalization\n\nAs you build your integrations, you can update this file with:\n- Specific build/test commands once you establish them\n- Architecture decisions as you make them\n- Integration-specific guidelines\n\nWhat type of Claude integration would you like to start building first?\n\n---\n\nUser: now hopefully this works nowadays :D\n\nAgent: Great! Now you're in `/home/skogix/claude` directory. Let me check what's in this directory to see what Claude-related setup you have here.\n\nI see you have a git repository set up with a minimal README. Let's see if there's any existing git history or branches that might give us context.\n\nPerfect! You have a fresh git repo ready. Since you mentioned you're remaking all your Claude-related integrations from scratch, what would you like to build first? Some ideas:\n\n- **CLI tool** for interacting with Claude API\n- **Shell integration** (bash/zsh functions and aliases)\n- **Editor plugin** (vim, neovim, vscode)\n- **API wrapper** library\n- **Automation scripts**\n\nWhat type of integration interests you most, or do you have something specific in mind?"}]},"uuid":"10d03865-a4ee-4c9a-81b0-9c65966b24a0","timestamp":"2025-11-01T03:58:52.515Z"}
