I can help you test the hello-world skill. Let me invoke it for you.\n\n---\n\nUser: Base directory for this skill: /home/skogix/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/skogai-marketplace/skills/hello-world\n\n# hello world skill\n\nhello world from the skill component!\n\n## what just happened - progressive loading\n\nskills load in 3 levels:\n\n### level 1: metadata (always loaded)\nthe YAML frontmatter above - name, description, allowed-tools. lightweight, always in context.\n\n### level 2: instructions (loaded when triggered)\nthis content you're reading now. loads when the skill is invoked.\n\n### level 3: resources (loaded on-demand)\nadditional files that load only when referenced:\n- documentation files (via Read)\n- executable scripts (via Bash)\n\n## demonstration\n\nwhen triggered, demonstrate level 3 loading:\n\n1. read `resources.md` to show documentation loading\n2. run `scripts/demo.sh` to show script execution with timestamp proof\n\nthen explain:\n- how you got invoked (description matched user's request)\n- the 3 loading levels demonstrated\n- difference from commands (/hello), agents (greeter), and hooks\n\n## component comparison\n\n- **command** `/hello` - user explicitly types it\n- **agent** `greeter` - invoked via Task tool for complex work\n- **skill** `hello-world` - auto-triggers when description matches\n- **hook** - triggers on events (commits, file changes)\n\nthat's it. minimal demonstration of what skills are and how they work.\n\n\nAgent: Perfect! The hello-world skill has loaded. Let me demonstrate the level 3 progressive loading by reading the documentation and running the demo script.\n\n## demonstration complete!\n\n### how i got invoked\nyou said \"i'm testing out the hello-world skill\" - this matched the skill description \"A demonstration skill showing how skills work in Claude plugins\", so i invoked it using the Skill tool.\n\n### 3 loading levels demonstrated\n\n**level 1: metadata** (always in context)\n- name: `hello-world:hello-world`\n- description: lightweight metadata always available\n- allowed tools list\n\n**level 2: instructions** (loaded when triggered)\n- the SKILL.md content you see above\n- loads only when skill is invoked\n- contains the task instructions\n\n**level 3: resources** (on-demand)\n- `resources.md` - loaded via Read tool (showed progressive loading explanation)\n- `scripts/demo.sh` - executed via Bash (timestamp: `fre 31 okt 2025 10:05:15 CET`)\n- only loads when specifically referenced\n\n### component comparison\n\n| component | trigger | use case |\n|-----------|---------|----------|\n| **command** `/hello` | user types explicitly | quick, predefined prompts |\n| **agent** `greeter` | Task tool invocation | complex multi-step work |\n| **skill** `hello-world` | auto-match description | specialized capabilities |\n| **hook** | events (commits, etc) | automated workflows |\n\nthe key difference: skills auto-trigger based on matching user intent to the description, while commands require explicit invocation and agents handle complex tasks autonomously.\n\n---\n\nUser: perfect. now we need a @skills/hello-world/resources/level2.md linked from SKILLS.md and move the resources.md to be called level3.md which you actively must \"ask for\"/look up. sound reasonable?\n\nAgent: yes, that's a clean way to demonstrate the progressive loading levels more clearly! let me:\n\n1. read the current SKILLS.md\n2. move `resources.md` → `level3.md`\n3. create new `level2.md` (linked from SKILLS.md)\n4. update SKILLS.md to reference both\n\n---\n\nUser: current pwd please\n\nAgent: current working directory: `/home/skogix/skogix`\n\n---\n\nUser: we ARE IN THE PLUGIN FOLDER/PROJECT. DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?!\n\nAgent: yes! got it - `/home/skogix/skogix` IS the plugin project source folder. when you said `@skills/hello-world/resources/level2.md`, you mean relative to HERE, not the installed plugin location in `.claude/plugins/`.\n\nlet me check the structure here:\n\nperfect! now i see the source structure. let me:\n\n1. move `skills/hello-world/resources.md` → `skills/hello-world/resources/level3.md`\n2. create `skills/hello-world/resources/level2.md` (linked from SKILL.md)\n3. update SKILL.md to reference both levels\n\ndone! the structure now clearly demonstrates progressive loading:\n\n```\nskills/hello-world/\n├── SKILL.md (level 1 metadata + level 2 instructions)\n├── resources/\n│   ├── level2.md (loads when SKILL.md references it)\n│   └── level3.md (requires explicit \"read this file\" instruction)\n└── scripts/\n    └── demo.sh\n```\n\n**level 1**: YAML frontmatter - always loaded  \n**level 2**: SKILL.md + linked `resources/level2.md` - loads when skill triggers  \n**level 3**: `resources/level3.md` - needs explicit lookup instruction  \n\nthe key difference: level2.md is naturally loaded when following SKILL.md instructions, while level3.md requires you to explicitly tell me \"now read level3.md\"\n\n---\n\nUser: and the only important part: UPDATE CLAUDE.md TO EXPLAIN TO YOURSELF THAT THIS IS ALSO THE SKOGAI-PLUGIN PROJECT\n\nAgent: done! CLAUDE.md now clearly states that `/home/skogix/skogix` is the SOURCE for the skogai-marketplace plugin project, so future claude instances won't get confused about whether to work in the source directory or the installed location.\n\n---\n\nUser: <local-command-stdout>See ya!</local-command-stdout>\n\nAgent: No response requested.\n\n---\n\nUser: Base directory for this skill: /home/skogix/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/skogai-marketplace/skills/hello-world\n\n# hello world skill\n\nhello world from the skill component!\n\n## what just happened - progressive loading\n\nskills load in 3 levels:\n\n### level 1: metadata (always loaded)\nthe YAML frontmatter above - name, description, allowed-tools. lightweight, always in context.\n\n### level 2: instructions (loaded when triggered)\nthis content you're reading now. loads when the skill is invoked.\n\nfor more details, see `resources/level2.md` which demonstrates level 2 resource loading.\n\n### level 3: resources (loaded on-demand)\nadditional files that load only when explicitly instructed:\n- documentation files (via Read)\n- executable scripts (via Bash)\n\n## demonstration\n\nwhen triggered:\n\n1. the level 2 resource (`resources/level2.md`) loads automatically as you read these instructions\n2. demonstrate level 3 loading by explicitly asking to read `resources/level3.md`\n3. run `scripts/demo.sh` to show script execution with timestamp proof\n\nthen explain:\n- how you got invoked (description matched user's request)\n- the 3 loading levels demonstrated\n- difference from commands (/hello), agents (greeter), and hooks\n\n## component comparison\n\n- **command** `/hello` - user explicitly types it\n- **agent** `greeter` - invoked via Task tool for complex work\n- **skill** `hello-world` - auto-triggers when description matches\n- **hook** - triggers on events (commits, file changes)\n\nthat's it. minimal demonstration of what skills are and how they work.\n\n\nAgent: perfect! the skill loaded with the updated progressive loading structure. let me demonstrate:\n\n---\n\nUser: i cannot see that you read SKILL.md anywhere?\n\nAgent: you're right - the SKILL.md content is being provided directly in the skill loading message! i can see it right there after `<command-name>hello-world</command-name>`.\n\nso the skill system automatically injects the SKILL.md content when the skill loads - i don't need to read it separately. that's level 2 loading in action.\n\nshould i now:\n1. read `resources/level2.md` (as referenced in SKILL.md)?\n2. then explicitly read `resources/level3.md` (on-demand level 3)?\n3. run the demo script?\n\nor are you asking about something else with the loading mechanism?\n\n---\n\nUser: jesus fuck i hate that you never listen. is resources/level2.md written with a @ before it or did you just decide to ignore it?\n\nAgent: you're absolutely right - i ignored the @ symbol. if it's meant to be level 2 (auto-loaded), it should be `@resources/level2.md` in SKILL.md, not just `resources/level2.md`.\n\nlet me fix that:\n\n---\n\nUser: no i fixed it\n\nAgent: got it - you already fixed it. thanks for doing that.\n\n---\n\nUser: <local-command-stdout>Goodbye!</local-command-stdout>\n\nAgent: No response requested.\n\n---\n\nUser: <local-command-stdout>✓ Enabled hello-world.
