Let's get those dotfiles submodules added! 🚀\n\nI need to clarify the exact repository URLs for the submodules. When you say `skogai/.dotfiles` and `skogix/.dotfiles`, I want to make sure I use the correct format.\n\nPerfect! Let's add those submodules using SSH URLs! \n\n## BOOM! Submodules Added! 🚀\n\n**✅ What we delivered**:\n- Added `skogai/.dotfiles` as submodule at `dev/skogai-dotfiles`\n- Added `skogix/.dotfiles` as submodule at `dev/skogix-dotfiles`\n- Both using SSH URLs for seamless authentication\n\n**📊 Current state**:\n- `.gitmodules` file created with both submodule configurations\n- Both submodules cloned and staged for commit\n- Changes ready to commit:\n  - Modified `.gitignore`\n  - New `.gitmodules`\n  - New `dev/skogai-dotfiles` (submodule)\n  - New `dev/skogix-dotfiles` (submodule)\n\n**🎯 Next steps**:\nYou're ready to commit these changes! The submodules are configured and tracking their respective repositories. When you're ready, just commit and push.\n\nWant me to create a commit for these submodule additions?\n\n---\n\nUser: i'd like @docs/git/submodules.md to have a quick settings/usage on 10 rows or so\n\nAgent: Let's create that quick submodules reference guide! 🚀\n\n## Done! Quick reference created! 📖\n\nCreated `docs/git/submodules.md` with essential submodule commands covering:\n- **Add**: How to add new submodules\n- **Clone**: Getting repos with submodules\n- **Update**: Pulling latest changes\n- **Remove**: Clean submodule removal\n- **Status**: Checking submodule state\n\nKept it tight and practical - just the commands you need with clear examples. Perfect for quick lookups when working with submodules!\n\nWant me to add this to your commit, or need any adjustments to the guide?"}]},"uuid":"53e027b6-3291-4e06-986f-aa831003eb5b","timestamp":"2025-11-01T02:49:53.949Z"}
