What happened, what was built/discussed. Use <summary></summary> tags.\n\nUser: no need. please continue\n\nAgent: **Config directory has 323 files across 17 subdirectories!**\n\nQuick priorities - which ones are most important to you?\n\n1. **i3** - Window manager config\n2. **kitty** - Terminal emulator\n3. **aichat** - AI chat tool (lots of files)\n4. **rofi** - Application launcher\n5. **picom** - Compositor\n\nWant me to check specific directories or should I add the essential ones (i3, kitty, rofi)?\n\n---\n\nUser: obviously something wrong. find the weird folders so we can remove them asap\n\nAgent: **Found the culprits!**\n\n1. **config/aichat/** - 240 files! Contains:\n   - 33 session files\n   - Multiple agent directories\n   - 3.1MB messages.md file\n   - 80KB aichat.log\n   - Tons of cached/historical data\n\n2. **config/systemd/** - Probably has user services\n\nShould we:\n- Remove entire aichat directory (keep only config.yaml)?\n- Check what's in systemd?\n- Keep only essential configs (i3, kitty, rofi)?\n\n---\n\nUser: now i have ran rcdn. but how do i \"move back the original files\" like config/aichat/sessions/* \n\nAgent: After running `rcdn` (which removes symlinks), you need to copy back the original files from your home directory to the dotfiles repo:\n\n---\n\nUser: i never trust your bad commands. read man rcm to find how to actually do it\n\nAgent: **Ah! Use `mkrc` to properly move files into dotfiles:**\n\n```bash\n# For regular files (will be prefixed with dot)\nmkrc ~/.config/aichat/config.yaml\n\n# For directories/files without dot prefix\nmkrc -U .config/aichat/sessions\n```\n\nThis will:\n1. Copy the file/directory to your dotfiles repo\n2. Create the symlink back to your home directory\n\nWant me to use mkrc to properly add the config files you want to keep?\n\n---\n\nUser: yes. but the other way around....\nconfig/aichat/sessions is not something i want to have saved in dotfiles\n\nAgent: Ah, you want to **exclude** those files from being managed by rcm! Let me check how to properly ignore them:\n\nTo exclude the aichat session files and logs, update your rcrc:\n\n---\n\nUser: no. listen. \n\ni have teh files already in ./config/aichat/sessions/\n\ni just want to move them back to $HOME/.config/aichat/sessions/ without you fucking up every command ever\n\nAgent: Got it! You want to move the files from `./config/aichat/sessions/` back to `$HOME/.config/aichat/sessions/`:\n\nDone! Files moved back to `~/.config/aichat/sessions/`. Now remove them from the dotfiles repo:\n\n---\n\nUser: good. now what is next in the crazy folders?\n\nAgent: **Current status:**\n- aichat cleaned up (only agents, config.yaml, .env left)\n- systemd has 11 service files (all skogai-* services)\n\n**Other potentially bloated directories:**\n\n**Directories to review:**\n1. **byobu** - 15 files (terminal multiplexer, do you use it?)\n2. **systemd** - 11 services (keep or move elsewhere?)\n3. **fish** - 3 files (alternative shell, needed?)\n4. **homarr, mods, pipewire** - check if needed?\n\nWhich should we keep vs remove?\n\n---\n\nUser: now please group all the rest of the files into ./todo.md so i dont have to explain what we do each new review\n\nAgent: I'll create a todo.md file grouping all the remaining files and directories for review.\n\nExample: <summary>Implemented HID keyboard functionality for ESP32.
