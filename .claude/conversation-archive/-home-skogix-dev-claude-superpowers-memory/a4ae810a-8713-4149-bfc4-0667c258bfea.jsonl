What happened, what was built/discussed. Use <summary></summary> tags.\n\nUser: now i ran \"/git please commit the related git-flow documentation\"\n\nhow should the agent or the /-command be able to do that? what we should have done is created a script which only lets `git add <path>` take $1 as a path\n\nAgent: Exactly! The command should be able to intelligently handle \"commit the related git-flow documentation\" by:\n\n1. **Understanding context** - \"related git-flow documentation\" means the files we just modified\n2. **Selective staging** - Only add the specific files that match the description\n3. **Safe operations** - Never use wildcards or `-A`\n\nWe should have created a simple, safe script:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# safe-add.sh\n# Only allows adding specific paths, one at a time\n\nPATH_TO_ADD=\"$1\"\n\nif [ -z \"$PATH_TO_ADD\" ]; then\n    echo \"Error: No path specified\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nif [ ! -e \"$PATH_TO_ADD\" ]; then\n    echo \"Error: Path does not exist: $PATH_TO_ADD\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\ngit add \"$PATH_TO_ADD\"\necho \"Staged: $PATH_TO_ADD\"\n```\n\nThen the command logic would:\n1. Parse \"git-flow documentation\" → identify `docs/git.md`, `CLAUDE.md`\n2. Call `safe-add.sh docs/git.md`\n3. Call `safe-add.sh CLAUDE.md`\n4. Run `git commit -m \"feat: Add git-flow workflow documentation\"`\n\nThe command needs enough intelligence to map user intent to specific files, then use safe, constrained scripts that can't accidentally destroy the repository. Each script does ONE thing with explicit parameters, no interactive prompts, no wildcards.\n\n---\n\nUser: since you create tasks \"async\" / in order with one call it does not matted for now. please create the git-add.sh script which takes only a path to a file\n\nAgent: Created `git-add.sh` - a safe, single-purpose script that:\n- Takes exactly one file path as argument\n- Validates the file exists\n- Adds only that specific file\n- Returns clear success/failure status\n\nNo wildcards, no `-A`, no interactive prompts. The command can now safely stage files one by one with explicit control.\n\n---\n\nUser: please remove quick-commit.sh and create a real commit script which is sane\n\nAgent: Created `git-commit.sh` - a sane commit script that:\n- Takes only a commit message as parameter\n- Requires files to be already staged (no automatic staging)\n- Checks that there are actually staged changes\n- Shows what was committed\n- Clear error messages\n\nNow the workflow is explicit and safe:\n1. Use `git-add.sh` to stage specific files one by one\n2. Use `git-commit.sh` to commit with a message\n3. No surprises, no accidental staging\n\nExample: <summary>Implemented HID keyboard functionality for ESP32. Hit Bluetooth controller initialization error, fixed by adjusting memory allocation.</summary>"}]},"uuid":"3db1df14-2374-41d7-869c-a12bcc4c3634","timestamp":"2025-11-01T03:56:17.510Z"}
