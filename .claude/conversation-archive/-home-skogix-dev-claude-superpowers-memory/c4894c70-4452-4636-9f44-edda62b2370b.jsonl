What would you like to work on today?\n\n---\n\nUser: i'm looking over your claude code settings overall\n\nAgent: I can see your Claude Code settings from the CLAUDE.md files:\n\n**Global settings** (~/.claude/CLAUDE.md):\n- Your username is set to \"skogix\"\n\n**Project settings** (./CLAUDE.md):\n- Fresh repository for Claude integrations, migrating from beta to stable Claude Code\n- No specific architecture or commands established yet\n- Emphasis on building integrations from scratch\n- Instructions to document new build/test commands as they're created\n\nThe project appears to be in its initial setup phase. Is there anything specific about the settings you'd like to adjust or configure?\n\n---\n\nUser: there we go. do you have any preferred or recommended ways to keep long term todo lists or tasks?\n\nAgent: For long-term todo lists and tasks, I recommend:\n\n**Built-in todo tracking** - I can maintain todos during our conversation using the TodoWrite tool. These are session-based but help track complex multi-step tasks.\n\n**Memory feature** - For persistent tasks across sessions:\n- Use `#` to quickly add task memories (e.g., `# TODO: implement authentication system`)\n- Use `/memory` to directly edit and organize longer task lists\n- Add recurring tasks or project milestones to your CLAUDE.md file\n\n**Hybrid approach** (recommended):\n1. Keep high-level goals and recurring tasks in CLAUDE.md\n2. Use memory (`#` or `/memory`) for medium-term tasks that span multiple sessions\n3. Let me use TodoWrite for immediate session tasks\n\nSince you have vim mode enabled, you might prefer `/memory` for bulk editing task lists. The auto-checkpointing feature you have enabled will also help preserve state between sessions.\n\nWould you like me to help set up a task management structure in your CLAUDE.md or explore the memory features?\n\n---\n\nUser: <local-command-stdout>Opened memory file at ./CLAUDE.md\n\n> Using $EDITOR=\"nvim\". To change editor, set $EDITOR or $VISUAL environment variable.</local-command-stdout>\n\nAgent: No response requested.\n\n---\n\nUser: now this simple solution might work for now i think\n\nAgent: Good setup! Having your todo list at `~/skogix/todo.md` is a clean, simple approach. I can see you have a couple of tasks there:\n- taskwarrior\n- skogcli config x.env categories\n\nSince you've added the path to memory, I'll be able to reference your todo list across sessions. This gives you a persistent, editor-friendly way to manage tasks outside of Claude while still letting me see what you're working on.\n\nWorks well with your vim setup too - you can quickly edit it whenever needed."}]},"uuid":"1bf6dd28-18e0-4eed-8f53-da10843635c7","timestamp":"2025-11-01T03:56:32.268Z"}
