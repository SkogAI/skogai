Let me invoke the statusline-setup agent for this task.\n\n---\n\nUser: The user wants to add worktree information to their Claude Code statusline. \n\nPlease help configure the statusline to include git worktree information. This should show relevant worktree details like the current worktree name or path when working in a git worktree.\n\nKey requirements:\n1. Read the current statusline configuration to understand the existing setup\n2. Add worktree information to the statusline in a useful way\n3. The worktree info should be visible when working in a git worktree\n4. Preserve any existing statusline customizations\n\nPlease implement this configuration and explain what changes were made.\n\nAgent: I'll help you configure the statusline to include git worktree information. Let me start by examining your current Claude Code settings and understanding what's already configured.\n\nGreat! I can see you already have a statusline configuration that shows the current directory, git branch information, and model name. Now I'll enhance it to include git worktree information. Let me create a more comprehensive script that can detect and display worktree details.\n\nPerfect! I've successfully updated your Claude Code statusline configuration to include git worktree information. Here's what I changed:\n\n## Changes Made\n\nThe updated statusline now includes worktree detection logic that:\n\n1. **Preserves your existing configuration**: All your current formatting (colors, directory name, git status, model info) remains intact\n2. **Adds worktree detection**: Uses `git worktree list --porcelain` to detect if the current directory is a git worktree\n3. **Shows worktree info when relevant**: When you're in a worktree, it displays `[wt:worktree-name]` after the branch status\n4. **Only shows when necessary**: The worktree info only appears when you're actually in a worktree (not in the main repository)\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe enhanced statusline will now display:\n- **In main repo**: `directory-name (branch ✔/✗) [Model Name]` (same as before)\n- **In worktree**: `directory-name (branch ✔/✗) [wt:worktree-name] [Model Name]` (new!)\n\nFor example, if you're in your current worktree, you'll see something like:\n```\nclaude-statusline-worktree (claude-statusline-worktree ✔) [wt:claude-statusline-worktree] [Claude 3.5 Sonnet]\n```\n\n## Technical Details\n\nThe worktree detection:\n- Uses `git worktree list --porcelain` to get worktree information\n- Extracts the current worktree's branch information\n- Compares it with the current branch to determine if we're in a worktree\n- Shows the worktree name (basename of the directory) when detected\n\nThe configuration file updated: `/home/skogix/.claude/settings.json`\n\n## Important Note\n\nThis statusline setup agent must be used for any further status line changes. You can continue to ask Claude to make additional modifications to the status line configuration as needed.\n\nYour statusline is now ready to show worktree information! The changes will take effect the next time Claude Code refreshes the status line.\n\nYour statusline has been successfully configured to include worktree information! When you're working in a git worktree, you'll now see `[wt:worktree-name]` displayed in your statusline after the branch status.\n\nThe worktree indicator will only appear when you're actually in a worktree, keeping your statusline clean when working in regular repositories."}]},"uuid":"84e15ea4-55d1-4158-b675-55bafcfc03ee","timestamp":"2025-11-01T03:57:29.144Z"}
