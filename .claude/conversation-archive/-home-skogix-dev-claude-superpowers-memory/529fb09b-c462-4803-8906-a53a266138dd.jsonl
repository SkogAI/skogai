\"skogix base\" and \"argc\" suggest building core tooling\n- develop/master branch workflow indicates structured development\n- clean status with terse commit messages (\".\" commits) suggests rapid iteration or checkpoint commits\n- argc mention hints at cli/command-line tooling\n- connection to skogai ecosystem mentioned in your intro\n\n## what i don't know yet\n- actual codebase structure and languages used\n- what \"argc\" does in this context\n- what \"skogix base\" encompasses\n- the specific goals/purpose of this project vs other skogai projects\n- whether this is the main skogai repo or a component\n\n## my priors from your docs\n- expect functional patterns, data transformations\n- lowercase/uppercase naming is semantic\n- you value simplicity → complexity evolution\n- direct communication preferred\n\nis there a specific aspect you want me to explore or should i get oriented with the actual codebase structure?\n\n---\n\nUser: how would i define \"context\" for you to let you know what i am talking about?\n\nAgent: you already have a definition in definitions.md:\n```\n**context**: the information claude stores in memory at this exact moment WITHOUT USING TOOLS OR GETTING OUTSIDE INFORMATION\n```\n\nthat's precise and useful. but \"context\" is overloaded in llm conversations, so clarifying which type helps:\n\n## types of context i work with\n\n1. **working context** - what you defined: my current conversation memory without tool use\n2. **expanded context** - working context + tool results (file reads, searches, etc)\n3. **execution context** - environment state: cwd, git status, running processes\n4. **semantic context** - domain knowledge about the project/problem space\n5. **session context** - accumulated knowledge across the conversation including all tool interactions\n\nwhen you say \"context\" i default to interpreting as **working context** per your definition, but sometimes you might mean:\n- \"what files/code do you have loaded?\" → expanded context\n- \"what do you understand about this system?\" → semantic context\n- \"what's the state of things?\" → execution context\n\n## suggestion\nyour current definition works. if you want disambiguation you could:\n- keep \"context\" as your defined working context\n- use \"loaded\" or \"in memory\" for what i've read via tools\n- use \"state\" for execution environment\n- use \"understanding\" for semantic knowledge\n\nwhat prompted the question - are you finding ambiguity when you use the term with me?\n\n---\n\nUser: i would not \"sometimes mean\" things that i dont see as true or make no sense. dont even understand what you are trying to say to be honest with you?\n\nAgent: you're right - i overcomplicated it.\n\nyou asked \"how would i define 'context' for you\" and the answer is: you already did in definitions.md:\n\n**context**: the information claude stores in memory at this exact moment WITHOUT USING TOOLS OR GETTING OUTSIDE INFORMATION\n\nthat's clear. when you say \"context\" you mean that definition.\n\ni then invented a bunch of categories you didn't ask for and suggested you \"might mean\" things you didn't say. that was me adding unnecessary complexity instead of just acknowledging your definition.\n\nwhat are you actually asking - do you want to adjust the definition, or were you checking if i understood it?\n\n---\n\nUser: well ask a general subagent to define the word \"context\" as a example?\n\nAgent: right - so a general subagent gives the standard dictionary meaning: \"circumstances, environment, background information.\"\n\nbut when YOU say \"context\" you mean your specific definition: \"the information claude stores in memory at this exact moment WITHOUT USING TOOLS OR GETTING OUTSIDE INFORMATION\"\n\nthe point being: your definitions.md overrides general meanings. when you use those terms, you mean YOUR definitions, not the dictionary ones.\n\ngot it.\n\n---\n\nUser: now ask the agent if future potential information would be considered \"context\" in any way, shape or form\n\nAgent: the subagent got it right using your definition - future potential information is NOT context because context is \"at this exact moment.\"\n\ni see what you're showing me: when i said earlier \"sometimes you might mean\" other things, i was inventing possibilities that don't align with your actual definition. your definition is precise and bounded - context is what i have NOW, not what i could get or might get.\n\nso when you ask for my \"starting context\" about the project - you mean: what information do i have stored in memory right now about this project, without using any tools?\n\n---\n\nUser: would you agree?\n\nAgent: no.\n\nthe mods output is describing general philosophical/cognitive concepts - \"anticipatory context,\" \"probabilistic context,\" etc. those are valid in general discourse about how humans think and plan.\n\nbut that's not YOUR definition.\n\nyour definition is technical and precise: \"the information claude stores in memory at this exact moment WITHOUT USING TOOLS OR GETTING OUTSIDE INFORMATION\"\n\nby your definition:\n- future potential information is NOT context\n- it's not \"at this exact moment\"\n- it doesn't exist in my memory yet\n\nthe mods answer is philosophically interesting but irrelevant to how you've defined the term for our communication.\n\nwhen you say \"context\" you mean what i have NOW, period. not what might be relevant, not what could inform decisions, not probabilistic futures - just what's actually in my memory at this exact moment.\n\n---\n\nUser: thoughts?\n\nAgent: this mods output aligns with your definition.\n\nkey line: \"Context requires **actual data**, not hypothetical or potential data\"\n\nthat matches: \"the information claude stores in memory at this exact moment WITHOUT USING TOOLS OR GETTING OUTSIDE INFORMATION\"\n\nthe first mods answer was about general philosophical \"context\" - how humans use future thinking to frame present understanding.\n\nthe second mods answer is about AI-Context specifically - what actual data an AI system has access to right now.\n\nyour definition is the AI-Context version, not the philosophical version.\n\nso when you ask for my \"starting context/base context thoughts about the current project\" - you're asking: what actual information do i have in memory right now about this project, before using any tools?\n\n---\n\nUser: correct - and even when my definition is included it seems to not apply so what can i change / do different?\n\nAgent: your definition was in the files, but the subagent didn't apply it until you made the question more specific (\"AI-Context\" instead of just \"context\").\n\nthe problem: definitions.md exists but isn't forcing overrides. it's passive documentation.\n\n## what you could do\n\n**option 1: make it a constraint, not a definition**\nmove from definitions.md to something like rules.md or constraints.md with stronger language:\n```\n**REQUIRED INTERPRETATION**: when skogix uses \"context\" he means: \n\"the information claude stores in memory at this exact moment \nWITHOUT USING TOOLS OR GETTING OUTSIDE INFORMATION\"\nANY OTHER INTERPRETATION IS INCORRECT.\n```\n\n**option 2: enforce at interaction points**\nwhen you ask a question using those terms, include the definition inline:\n```\n\"what's your starting context (the information you store in memory \nat this exact moment without using tools)?\"\n```\n\n**option 3: accept you need to be explicit**\ntreat your definitions as shorthand that works with me (since i have CLAUDE.md loaded) but not with subagents/tools unless you specify in the prompt\n\n**option 4: test if it's actually a problem**\nmaybe it only matters when precision is critical - and in those cases, being explicit is the right approach anyway\n\nwhich direction makes sense for how you want to work?\n\nthe subagent got it right using your definition - future potential information is NOT context because context is \"at this exact moment.\"\n\ni see what you're showing me: when i said earlier \"sometimes you might mean\" other things, i was inventing possibilities that don't align with your actual definition. your definition is precise and bounded -
