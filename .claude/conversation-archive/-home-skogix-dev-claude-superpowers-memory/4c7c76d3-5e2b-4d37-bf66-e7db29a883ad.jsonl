However, Claude Code does support:\n\n1. **Subagents** - Specialized agents that can be delegated tasks with their own isolated context\n2. **Git Worktrees** - For parallel Claude Code sessions working on different branches\n\nThe parallel execution happens automatically when you invoke multiple agents in a single message. To run agents in parallel, you simply need to:\n\n**Send multiple Task tool calls in a single message** rather than separate messages. For example, if you ask me to run multiple agents \"in parallel\", I'll send them all at once rather than sequentially.\n\nThere's no special setting you need to change - it's about how the agents are invoked. The key is requesting multiple agent tasks in one go rather than waiting for each to complete before starting the next.\n\n---\n\nUser: how would we test this? please write five famous sentences from a movie in /tmp/{1-5}.txt in parallel?\n\nAgent: I'll write five famous movie quotes to separate files in /tmp/ in parallel using multiple tool calls in a single message.\n\nDone! All five files were created in parallel with famous movie quotes. The parallel execution worked - all Write commands were sent in a single message and executed simultaneously.\n\n---\n\nUser: now how do we do the same but add 1-5 seconds delay?\n\nAgent: I'll create the files with delays using background bash commands running in parallel. Each command will sleep for a different duration before writing the file.\n\nAll five commands are now running in parallel with staggered delays (1-5 seconds). Let me check their output to confirm completion:\n\nPerfect! All five background processes completed successfully. The files were created in parallel with their respective delays (1-5 seconds), and each process finished independently. This demonstrates true parallel execution with different completion times.\n\n---\n\nUser: perfect. we now know it is working when i tell  you to do it at least :)\n\nAgent: Exactly! The parallel execution works perfectly when you explicitly ask for it. All five commands ran simultaneously with their different delays, proving that Claude Code can handle true parallel operations when requested. \n\nThe key is in how the request is made - when you ask for parallel execution, I send all the tool calls in a single message rather than sequentially. No special settings needed! :)"}]},"uuid":"bebbdd0a-b6de-4303-b0fc-7ef439ea1e03","timestamp":"2025-11-01T03:55:30.510Z"}
