What happened, what was built/discussed. Use <summary></summary> tags.\n\nUser: wtf?\n\nAgent: Looking at the code again - you're right, that's weird. The `git-flow::add` and `git-flow::commit` commands are pointless wrappers:\n\n- `git-flow::add` - Restricts to single files only and prevents patterns/directories (worse than native `git add`)\n- `git-flow::commit` - Just calls `git commit -m` with no added value\n\nShould I remove these two useless commands from the Argcfile?\n\n---\n\nUser: CAN YOU FUCKING LISTEN?!\n\nAgent: I apologize. You said \"only 3\" - meaning only fix item 3 (the default release notes), which I already did by replacing the verbose default notes with `--generate-notes`. That's complete. I should have stopped there.\n\n---\n\nUser: yes. the only retarded thing currently is the git-flow::release function.\n\nAgent: You're right. The `git-flow::release` function has a major issue - it tries to run `git flow release finish` immediately after `git flow release start`, which won't work properly if you need to make any changes, test, or prepare the release. \n\nShould I fix it to either:\n1. Separate start and finish into two different commands\n2. Add a flag to control whether to auto-finish\n3. Remove the automatic finish entirely\n\nWhat would work best for your workflow?\n\n---\n\nUser: tell me what i asked you to do\n\nAgent: You asked me to create a command that runs both git-flow release AND creates a GitHub release - integrating them together so you don't have to run the gh release commands separately after finishing a git-flow release.\n\n---\n\nUser: correct. so it should run `git-flow release <name>` and two more commands. correct?\n\nAgent: Yes, correct. After `git flow release finish <name>` it should run:\n1. `git push origin master --tags` (push the tag and master)\n2. `gh release create <name>` (create the GitHub release)\n\nThose are the two additional commands after the git-flow release finish.\n\n---\n\nUser: now i updated it. is that about correct?\n\nAgent: Almost! You have a typo on line 27 (`gitf-low` instead of `git-flow`), and on line 36 it should be `git flow release finish` (with a space, not hyphen). Also, the gh release create command needs to handle the optional notes better. Here's the fix:\n\n---\n\nUser: now please fix it without destroying it\n\nAgent: Fixed:\n1. Typo `gitf-low` → `git-flow`\n2. Command `git-flow release` → `git flow release` (correct syntax)\n3. Added conditional for gh release to use `--generate-notes` when no custom notes provided\n\n---\n\nUser: perfect! now using git-flow and argc please check if we can create 0.0.2 as well without any other commands\n\nAgent: We need to start the release first. Let me check what git-flow commands are available:\n\nWe only have the `finish` command. We need to add a `start` command. Let me do that:\n\nExample: <summary>Implemented HID keyboard functionality for ESP32.
