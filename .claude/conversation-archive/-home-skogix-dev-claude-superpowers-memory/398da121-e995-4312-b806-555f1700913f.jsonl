Let me start by understanding your current repository structure and branches.\n\nI see this is your dotfiles repository, not an Ansible repository. Could you clarify:\n\n1. Do you have Ansible code in another repository that you want to work with?\n2. Which branch contains the Ansible code you want to use as a reference?\n3. Are you looking to set up a worktree in a different repository, or are you planning to add Ansible configuration to your dotfiles?\n\n<options>\n    <option>I have a separate Ansible repository - let me navigate there</option>\n    <option>The Ansible code is in a different branch of this repo</option>\n    <option>I want to add Ansible configs to my dotfiles using another repo as reference</option>\n    <option>Let me provide the correct repository path</option>\n</options>"}]},"uuid":"e55459b8-ab34-4434-834f-d285ad2f693d","timestamp":"2025-11-01T03:53:16.393Z"}
