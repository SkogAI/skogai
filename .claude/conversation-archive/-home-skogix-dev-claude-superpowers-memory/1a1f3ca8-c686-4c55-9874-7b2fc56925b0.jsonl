Let me check the local submodule configuration and fix this.\n\nThe `.skogai` submodule repository is private, which is why the GitHub Actions can't access it. I'll update the CI workflow to skip submodule checkout or handle this gracefully.\n\nNo response requested.\n\n---\n\nUser: .skogai is private but we send a token for the accent to use\n\nAgent: You're right! We need to configure the workflows to use a token that has access to the private submodule. Let me update the workflows to use a Personal Access Token (PAT) for submodule access.\n\nNo response requested.\n\n---\n\nUser: read what I said. also we are literally downloading this from the same user and org - use the same key maybe?\n\nAgent: You're absolutely right! The workflows should use the same GitHub token that's already provided. The issue is that we're using the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` which doesn't have access to other repositories. We need to use the token parameter properly in the checkout action.\n\nNo response requested.\n\n---\n\nUser: read what I said. also we are literally downloading this from the same user and org - use the same key maybe?\n\nAgent: You're right! The submodule is from the same GitHub organization (SkogAI). The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` should work, but we need to make sure the checkout action is configured correctly. The issue is that the default token has limited permissions for submodules. Let me fix the workflows to properly handle the submodule checkout.\n\nNo response requested."}]},"uuid":"37a9e6c3-2861-4cc2-b7eb-a45f4e454e1d","timestamp":"2025-11-01T03:56:30.417Z"}
