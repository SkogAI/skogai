looking at the directory structure more carefully:\n\n**three distinct types:**\n\n1. **personal skills** - `~/.claude/skills/` - individual, cross-project skills you create yourself\n2. **project skills** - `.claude/skills/` - team-shared, in git repo\n3. **plugin skills** - bundled with installed plugins, show up automatically when plugin is installed\n\nthe confusion: that `~/.claude/skills/` directory actually looks like it **is** a plugin repository (notice the `.claude-plugin` directory and `.git`). so those skills are likely **plugin skills** that got installed there.\n\nlet me check:\n\nah! so `~/.claude/skills/` is actually the **anthropic/skills plugin** repository - not personal skills you created yourself.\n\n**the actual distinction:**\n\n1. **plugin skills** - installed via `/plugin marketplace add anthropics/skills` \n   - located at `~/.claude/skills/` (in this case)\n   - managed by the plugin system\n   - all those example skills (algorithmic-art, mcp-builder, etc.)\n\n2. **personal skills** - individual skills you create yourself\n   - would also go in `~/.claude/skills/` as separate directories\n   - not from a plugin, just your own custom skills\n   - you'd create like: `~/.claude/skills/my-custom-skill/SKILL.md`\n\n3. **project skills** - `.claude/skills/skogai/` in your case\n   - team-shared, checked into git\n   - available only in this project\n\nso technically you could have **both** plugin skills and personal skills in `~/.claude/skills/` - the plugin is just a subdirectory/repo there, and you could add your own skill folders alongside it.\n\nwant to create an actual personal skill to see the difference?\n\n---\n\nUser: i removed the .claude/skills from the global space now and will restart\n\nAgent: good call - that'll clean up the plugin skills from the global space. after you restart, you should only see the project skill (`.claude/skills/skogai/`) available.\n\nwhen you're back, we can see what skills are actually loaded and whether you want to create any personal skills or reinstall specific plugin skills you need.\n\n---\n\nUser: now i test again\n\nAgent: let me check what skills are available now:\n\nclean! now you only have:\n- **personal skills**: empty directory\n- **project skills**: `skogai` only\n\nlet me check what's in your skogai skill:\n\nyour **skogai** skill is a gh cli reference with:\n- pr operations\n- repo operations  \n- release management\n- workflows\n- api access\n- json/filtering patterns\n\n**issue spotted**: description is vague - `\"This is the new tool\"` - should be more specific like:\n\n```yaml\ndescription: GitHub CLI (gh) reference for pull requests, releases, workflows, and API operations. Use when working with GitHub via gh command.\n```\n\nwant me to:\n1. update the description for better discovery?\n2. test if i currently use it when you ask gh-related questions?\n3. something else?\n\n---\n\nUser: now i do believe you still should have some skills usable?\n\nAgent: let me check what's actually available now:\n\n---\n\nUser: CAN YOU JUST TELL ME WHAT YOUR TAG FROM CLAUDE CODE SAYS WTF?\n\nAgent: right, sorry - looking at what claude code tells me:\n\n**available skills:**\n\n1. **skogai** (project) - \"This is the new tool\"\n\n2. **example-skills plugin:**\n   - skill-creator\n   - mcp-builder\n   - canvas-design\n   - algorithmic-art\n   - internal-comms\n   - webapp-testing\n   - artifacts-builder\n   - slack-gif-creator\n   - theme-factory\n   - brand-guidelines\n\n3. **document-skills plugin:**\n   - xlsx\n   - docx\n   - pptx\n   - pdf\n\nso yes, the plugin skills are loaded even though you removed the global directory. they must be loaded from a different location or the plugin system manages them separately."}]},"uuid":"b0b0969b-800a-46ea-ac38-570591980562","timestamp":"2025-11-01T02:51:26.562Z"}
