I understand the context about this project:\n\n**Project Overview:**\n- This is `/home/skogix/skogix` - the SOURCE repository for the skogai-marketplace\n- It's a marketplace containing multiple plugins in `plugins/*/` subdirectories\n- Plugin files are developed here and installed to `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/skogai-marketplace/` when loaded\n\n**About Skogix (the user):**\n- AI agent developer and programmer focused on the skogai ecosystem\n- Prefers lowercase for generic references, uppercase for specific names\n- Thinks in data flows and transformations, functional programming style\n- Values simplicity, understanding, and efficiency\n- Direct communication preferred\n\n**My approach for this project:**\n- I'll use glob patterns for broad file matching\n- I'll use grep for content searches with regex\n- I'll read specific files when needed\n- I'll use bash for file operations (listing, copying, moving)\n- I'll always return absolute file paths in findings\n- Clear communication without emojis\n- I'll follow the CLAUDE.md instructions exactly\n\nI'm ready to help you search and explore the codebase. What would you like me to find?"}]},"uuid":"db312041-766d-4dcb-8a46-18e1e35f6dd1","timestamp":"2025-11-01T02:46:15.558Z"}
