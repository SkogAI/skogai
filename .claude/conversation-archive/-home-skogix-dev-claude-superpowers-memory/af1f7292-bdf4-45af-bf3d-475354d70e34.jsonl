From now on I'll:\n1. Modify `run.sh` if I need to change which playbook to run\n2. Execute it with `bash run.sh` using `run_in_background: true` \n3. Check output with BashOutput tool\n\nNo more direct `ansible-playbook` commands from me.\n\n---\n\nUser: now try running it as a \"background\"-whatever to test it out\n\nAgent: Perfect! Background execution works:\n- Started with shell ID `4b59f9`\n- Completed with exit code 0\n- All 13 tasks ok, 1 changed (ansible_facts.yml), 0 failed\n\nNow I can run playbooks via `run.sh` in the background and check output with BashOutput!\n\n---\n\nUser: perfect! the actual install can take quite long and blows up your cli :). now i added a new aur package (llm) and it have been installed without problems! :D\n\nAgent: Excellent! The full workflow is working:\n\n✓ aur_builder builds AUR packages\n✓ Passwordless sudo for pacman installation\n✓ Background execution handles long installs\n✓ New AUR package (llm) installed successfully\n\nThe 02_package_managers role is solid now. Ready to move on to the next role whenever you want!\n\n---\n\nUser: now please update your claude file with whats been learned so far\n\nAgent: Updated CLAUDE.md with:\n\n✓ **Running Playbooks** - Always use `run.sh` in background mode, never run `ansible-playbook` directly\n✓ **AUR Package Installation** - Complete workflow with `aur_builder` user, passwordless sudo setup, and correct `become` directive syntax\n✓ **Directory Structure** - Reflects actual structure with playbooks/, roles/, vars/, run.sh\n✓ **Usage Context** - Updated to show playbooks/roles are in this directory\n\nAll the key learnings from this session are now documented!\n\nExample: <summary>Implemented HID keyboard functionality for ESP32. Hit Bluetooth controller initialization error, fixed by adjusting memory allocation.</summary>"}]},"uuid":"e1fdb731-4a86-41d8-b07e-794b1e40f3e0","timestamp":"2025-11-01T03:51:46.843Z"}
