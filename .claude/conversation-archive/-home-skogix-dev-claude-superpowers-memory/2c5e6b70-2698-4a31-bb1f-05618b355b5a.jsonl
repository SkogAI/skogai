You can use:\n\n`argc git-flow release finish 0.0.3` \n\n(after starting it with `git flow release start 0.0.3`)\n\n---\n\nUser: i *really* hope we did not remove the git command....\n\nAgent: Let me check if the /git command still exists:\n\nGood news - `/git` command is still there! We didn't actually remove it. \n\nThe `/git` command exists! Based on the command definition, you should use:\n\n`/git finish release 0.0.3`\n\nThis will use the argc commands we set up to handle the complete release process.\n\n---\n\nUser: the whole reason is that the commands and agents should use argc instead of scripts\n\nAgent: Exactly! The `/git` command should call `argc git-flow release finish 0.0.3` instead of using agents or scripts.\n\nSo when you run `/git finish release 0.0.3`, it should:\n1. Parse \"finish release 0.0.3\" \n2. Call `argc git-flow release finish 0.0.3`\n3. Which runs our integrated function that does git-flow finish + push + gh release\n\nThe command just needs to map the user input to the appropriate argc command.\n\n---\n\nUser: no, the normal commands will look something like this: `/git please create a testing-release feature branch. add a ./README.md with \"testing release\" and commit and finish the feature. then create the release 0.0.3 and finish it as well.`\n\nwhich is why it needs to actually work\n\nAgent: Ah, I understand now! The `/git` command needs to handle complex, natural language requests that involve multiple git operations. It should:\n\n1. Parse the natural language request\n2. Break it down into multiple argc git-flow commands\n3. Execute them in sequence\n\nFor your example, it would:\n- `git flow feature start testing-release`\n- Create README.md with \"testing release\"\n- `argc git-flow add README.md`\n- `argc git-flow commit \"Add README with testing release\"`\n- `git flow feature finish testing-release`\n- `git flow release start 0.0.3`\n- `argc git-flow release finish 0.0.3`\n\nThe `/git` command acts as an intelligent orchestrator that uses the argc commands as building blocks. That's why we need both - argc provides the atomic operations, and `/git` provides the natural language interface.\n\nExample: <summary>Implemented HID keyboard functionality for ESP32.
