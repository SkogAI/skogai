How can I help you today?\n\n---\n\nUser: i want to know about your \"task agents\" and how you can actually spawn many simultaneously\n\nAgent: I can spawn specialized task agents to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously. These agents run independently and can work in parallel for maximum efficiency.\n\n## Available Agent Types\n\n- **general-purpose**: Research complex questions, search for code, execute multi-step tasks\n- **statusline-setup**: Configure your Claude Code status line settings\n- **output-style-setup**: Create Claude Code output styles\n- **github-agent**: Manage SkogAI GitHub repositories using git-flow\n\n## Parallel Execution\n\nWhen you want agents running simultaneously, I send a single message with multiple Task tool calls. For example, if you need me to:\n1. Research a codebase structure\n2. Analyze performance bottlenecks\n3. Check for security vulnerabilities\n\nI can launch all three agents at once, and they'll work independently, returning their results when complete.\n\nWould you like me to demonstrate by launching multiple agents for a specific task?"}]},"uuid":"06525647-a192-4020-8820-6c4d01e250ca","timestamp":"2025-11-01T03:55:45.170Z"}
