Start with the absolute minimum configuration\n   - Only 1-2 essential tools\n   - Basic agent description\n   - Simplest possible instructions\n\n2. Follow an iterative enhancement approach\n   - Add tools only when proven necessary\n   - Expand descriptions based on actual usage\n   - Document why each tool was added\n\n3. Benefits of this approach:\n   - Faster execution (fewer tools = less overhead)\n   - More predictable behavior\n   - Easier to debug and maintain\n   - Better token efficiency\n\nImplementation checklist:\n- [ ] Audit existing commands to identify agents they should use\n- [ ] Create minimal agent definitions for each command\n- [ ] Document the minimal-first principle in agent creation guide\n- [ ] Add examples of good vs bloated agents\n- [ ] Create template for minimal agent structure\n\nThis aligns with our documented architecture where commands act as context-aware translators and agents are focused executors with minimal tool access.\n\nPlease create this issue with labels like \"enhancement\", \"architecture\", or \"best-practices\" if available.\n\nAgent: I'll create this GitHub issue for you. Let me first check the repository context and then create the issue with the appropriate details.\n\nNow let me create the GitHub issue with your specifications:\n\nLet me try with just the available labels:\n\nLet me check what labels are available and create the issue without labels if needed:\n\nNow I'll create the issue with the available \"enhancement\" label:\n\nPerfect!

Parse the issue number from 15\n2. If no description provided, fetch it from GitHub using `gh issue view <number>`\n3. Create branch name as `feature/issue-<number>-<kebab-case-description>`\n4. Create worktree at `/home/skogix/dev/issue-<number>`\n5. Show confirmation with the worktree path and branch name\n\nThe worktree will be based on origin/develop.\n\n\nAgent: ✅ Created worktree for issue #15:\n- **Path**: `/home/skogix/dev/issue-15`\n- **Branch**: `feature/issue-15-ensure-commands-use-minimal-specialized-agents`\n- **Based on**: `origin/develop`\n\nYou can now navigate to the worktree and start implementing minimal specialized agents!\n\nExample: <summary>Implemented HID keyboard functionality for ESP32.
