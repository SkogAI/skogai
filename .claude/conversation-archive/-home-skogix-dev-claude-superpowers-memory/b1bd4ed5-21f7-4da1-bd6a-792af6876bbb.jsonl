What happened, what was built/discussed. Use <summary></summary> tags.\n\nUser: perfect. then we can do all the basic things here as well right? @vars/packages.yml can be ran through correct?\n\nAgent: Absolutely! We can load vars/packages.yml and install both pacman packages and AUR packages:\n\n---\n\nUser: changed name to all.yml\n\nAgent: Perfect! The role now:\n1. Loads vars/packages.yml\n2. Ensures yay is installed\n3. Installs all pacman packages from the list\n4. Installs all AUR packages from the list\n\nAll packages were already installed, so everything shows \"ok\" with no changes needed.\n\n---\n\nUser: i now added one not installed as the last test - run it again :)\n\nAgent: The package built successfully but failed to install because it needs sudo privileges. The AUR task needs `become: true`:\n\n---\n\nUser: do you remember this was a annoying problem before? setting sudo become like this?\n\nAgent: You're absolutely right! We had that issue before - using `become: true` causes the duplicate password prompt problem. \n\nThe issue is that yay built the package but needs sudo to install it. Maybe we need to set `become: true` on the playbook level instead of the task level, or there's a different way to handle this with the kewlfft.aur module?\n\n---\n\nUser: i have fought with this crap before ^^\n\nAgent: Ah! You have an `aur_builder` user set up. That's the proper way to handle AUR builds. Let me update the task to use that user:\n\nSame password issue. Since you've dealt with this before - how did you configure aur_builder? Does it need passwordless sudo for pacman, or is there a different approach for the kewlfft.aur module?\n\n---\n\nUser: actually i think it is the other way around?\n\nAgent: You mean run it without `become` at all and let the module handle it? Or configure it differently?\n\nLet me try without become?\n\n---\n\nUser: first ultrathink with me here. this is possible to reason through. you always want to run yay without sudo. and then sudo for the actual *sudo-priv\"\n\nwhich means the actual building and setup should be done by a user which is not available as a priv user (i.e. no sudo). we have aur_builder which is a simple \"i made it because i got angry at priv problems) which have nothing. that builder should probably build the packages and then let main user skogix normally continue?\n\nAgent: Ah! So:\n1. `aur_builder` builds the package (no sudo - makepkg refuses sudo)\n2. Then the main user `skogix` installs it with sudo\n\nSo maybe we need to tell the module to use `aur_builder` for building but then install as the current user? Let me check the module parameters - maybe there's a way to specify the build user separately from the install user?\n\nOr do we need to configure sudoers so `aur_builder` can run pacman installation without a password?\n\n---\n\nUser: we should be able to get by without any sodoers changes i assume\n\nAgent: Right - let me look at this logically. The kewlfft.aur module with `use: auto` will use yay, which:\n1. Builds packages as a non-root user (can't be root)\n2. Calls sudo internally to install the built package\n\nMaybe the module has a way to specify the build user? Let me check if there's something like a `become_user` parameter or if we need to configure it differently:\n\nPerfect! The documentation example shows:\n```yaml\nbecome: yes\nbecome_user: aur_builder\n```\n\nSo it should work with `become: true` and `become_user: aur_builder`. The issue is the duplicate password prompt.\n\nI think the problem is that when yay internally calls sudo during installation, it needs a password. For this to work without sudoers changes, maybe `aur_builder` needs passwordless sudo for pacman specifically? Or is there another way the module handles this?\n\nExample: <summary>Implemented HID keyboard functionality for ESP32.
