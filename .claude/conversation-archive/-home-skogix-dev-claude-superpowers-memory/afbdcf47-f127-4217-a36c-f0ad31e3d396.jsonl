It's most valuable for:\n\n1. **High-stakes decisions** - Architecture choices, security implementations, data migrations\n2. **Knowledge archaeology** - When recovering patterns from existing code where assumptions matter\n3. **Multi-agent coordination** - Helping other agents understand confidence levels in shared decisions\n\nFor everyday coding (fixing bugs, adding features, refactoring), it adds friction without proportional value. The constant self-assessment interrupts flow and clutters output.\n\nI'd suggest keeping it at the orchestration level - activate it contextually when uncertainty genuinely matters rather than as a blanket requirement. Perhaps trigger it with specific keywords or task types rather than enforcing it universally.\n\nThe principle itself is sound - explicit uncertainty is better than false confidence. But its application should be strategic, not dogmatic.\n\n[@certainty:75:\"Perhaps trigger it with specific keywords or task types rather than enforcing it universally\"]"}]},"uuid":"844f5c4a-22c7-4ab1-b586-54e24344211d","timestamp":"2025-11-01T03:55:54.099Z"}
