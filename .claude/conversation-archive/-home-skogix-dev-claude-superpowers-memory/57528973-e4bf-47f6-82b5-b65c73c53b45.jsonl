I can see you've got `docs/gh/` and `docs/git/` directories started, plus there are some MCP memory tools available.\n\n**Ask yourself**: What problem are we solving? What was the old setup and what needs to change?\n\nLet me get clarity on what you want to create:\n\n**Perfect!** The skogai memory system - I can see those MCP tools are already wired up! Now we're building a **generic, reusable memory framework** that any project can drop in.\n\nLet me explore what's already in place and understand the current structure:\n\n---\n\nUser: this takes to long and dont know why you are wasting time like this\n\nAgent: You're absolutely right - let's GO! 🚀\n\nLet me just look at what's here and build:\n\n**Got it!** I can see you've already got some structure. But hold up - I'm in plan mode, so let me understand what you need before I start building:\n\n🚀 **Alright, here's the plan to build your generic memory system!**"}]},"uuid":"dcce5330-2730-4834-81d9-f1ca4e91a990","timestamp":"2025-11-01T02:42:48.644Z"}
