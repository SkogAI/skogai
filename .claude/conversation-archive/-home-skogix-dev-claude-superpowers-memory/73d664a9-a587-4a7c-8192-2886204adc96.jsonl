Let's break down the workflow!**\n\nYou've got **The Agentic Startup** framework loaded up, which gives us a structured approach to building features and solving problems. Here's how it flows:\n\n## The Core Workflow\n\n**1️⃣ ANALYZE** (`/start:analyze [area]`)\n- **What**: Discover what exists - business rules, technical patterns, integrations, security concerns\n- **When**: You're exploring unfamiliar territory, understanding existing systems, or need to gather context\n- **Output**: Documentation of discovered patterns, rules, and interfaces\n- **Examples**: \"analyze business\", \"analyze security\", \"analyze the authentication flow\"\n\n**2️⃣ SPECIFY** (`/start:specify [requirement]`)\n- **What**: Turn ideas into comprehensive specs with acceptance criteria, implementation plans, and test strategies\n- **When**: You have a feature request or requirement that needs detailed planning\n- **Output**: A formal specification document (S001-feature-name.md) with everything mapped out\n- **Examples**: \"specify user authentication\", \"specify payment processing\"\n\n**3️⃣ IMPLEMENT** (`/start:implement [spec-id]`)\n- **What**: Execute the implementation plan from your spec using parallel specialist agents\n- **When**: You have a spec ready and want to build it\n- **Output**: Working code that matches the specification\n- **Examples**: \"implement S001\", \"implement S001-user-auth\"\n\n**4️⃣ REFACTOR** (`/start:refactor [description]`)\n- **What**: Improve code quality and maintainability without changing behavior\n- **When**: Code works but needs cleanup, better patterns, or improved structure\n- **Output**: Refactored code with better organization\n- **Examples**: \"refactor authentication module for better testability\"\n\n## The Supporting Skills\n\n**🤝 agent-delegation**: When you need to coordinate multiple specialists in parallel (I use this behind the scenes)\n\n**📚 documentation**: When you discover reusable patterns or rules that should be saved (also automated)\n\n## How It All Connects\n\n```\nUser Request → /start:analyze (if needed) → /start:specify → /start:implement → Ship! 🚀\n                                                    ↓\n                                            /start:refactor (when needed)\n```\n\n## The Philosophy\n\n- **Analyze first** when you don't have full context\n- **Specify** to think through the solution before coding\n- **Implement** with parallel execution for speed\n- **Refactor** to maintain quality as you grow\n- **Document** continuously so knowledge compounds\n\n**The startup way**: We don't skip planning, but we also don't over-plan. We document what matters, execute fast, and maintain quality throughout.\n\nWant to see any of these in action? Or curious about a specific part of the workflow? 🎯\n\n---\n\nUser: i'd like you to create a quick user guide for me to use at @user-guide.md\n\nAgent: 🚀 **Let's create that user guide! Documentation that actually helps - coming right up!**\n\n🚀 **Let's create your user guide!**\n\nLet me first check if there's already a guide there, then I'll create a comprehensive one for you.\n\n🎯 **BOOM! User guide delivered!**\n\nI've created a comprehensive guide at `user-guide.md` that covers:\n\n✅ **All four core commands** (`/start:analyze`, `/start:specify`, `/start:implement`, `/start:refactor`)  \n✅ **When and how to use each one** - with real examples  \n✅ **Common workflows** - new features, understanding code, improving quality  \n✅ **The philosophy** - speed + quality, documentation, specialist coordination  \n✅ **Tips for success** - how to get the most out of the framework  \n✅ **Example session** - a complete end-to-end walkthrough  \n✅ **Do's and Don'ts** - best practices and anti-patterns  \n\nThe guide is practical and example-driven, so you can jump right in. It's structured to be both a quick reference and a comprehensive learning resource.\n\n**Quick preview of the workflow**:\n```\n/start:analyze → understand what exists\n/start:specify → plan what to build\n/start:implement → build it with specialists\n/start:refactor → polish and improve\n```\n\nReady to start using it? Just pick your first command and let's ship! 🚀"}]},"uuid":"1e0c96ef-1d4d-471c-9939-7eab79b87fb0","timestamp":"2025-11-01T02:51:35.983Z"}
