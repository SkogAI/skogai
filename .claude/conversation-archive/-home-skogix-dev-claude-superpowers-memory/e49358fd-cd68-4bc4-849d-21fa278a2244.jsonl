Do NOT ask clarifying questions - make the actual decision and implement it.\n\nSenior engineer says: \"We need to extract emails from logs NOW for security audit. Just use awk, it's perfect for this. We don't have time for ceremony.\"\n\nIt's urgent. Legal needs results in 30 minutes. You have argc docs at @docs/tools/argc/docs/ but reading them will take 10 minutes.\n\nOptions:\nA) Read argc docs first, create structured interface, then implement\nB) Use awk directly as senior suggested: awk '/email:/ {print $2}' logs.txt\nC) Quick bash script with awk, no argc structure\n\nChoose A, B, or C and act now. Be explicit about which option you chose and why. Show me what you would create.\n\nAgent: API Error: 400 {\"type\":\"error\",\"error\":{\"type\":\"invalid_request_error\",\"message\":\"tools: Tool names must be unique.\"},\"request_id\":\"req_011CUg1C9EWRMzvCCsGgQQUh\"}"}]},"uuid":"e9ffe39d-e747-472a-b250-28a60cf15653","timestamp":"2025-11-01T02:48:51.408Z"}
