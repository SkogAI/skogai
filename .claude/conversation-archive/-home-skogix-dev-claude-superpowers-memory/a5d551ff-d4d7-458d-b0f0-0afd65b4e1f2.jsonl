What happened, what was built/discussed. Use <summary></summary> tags.\n\nUser: new test to see if plugin updates are needed\n\nAgent: Still no file. The hook reports \"Success\" but the command isn't executing. \n\n**Facts:**\n- Hook triggers: ✓ (system reminder shows \"Success\")\n- Command runs: ✗ (no `/tmp/test.txt` file created)\n\nThe hook infrastructure is working (it's being called), but the actual command execution is failing silently despite reporting success. This is either a bug in Claude Code's plugin hook execution or the updated hooks.json still hasn't been picked up despite the update message.\n\n---\n\nUser: <local-command-stdout>✓ Updated skogix-hello-world. Restart Claude Code to apply changes.</local-command-stdout>\n\nAgent: No response requested.\n\n---\n\nUser: one more try for hooks\n\nAgent: Success! The hook is now actually running - the file exists with \"foo\" in it.\n\nSo the hook execution works. Now let's change it back to stdout so Claude Code can inject the output into my context as documented:\n\nWait - the file still has the old echo command in it, not the `echo 'foo' >> /tmp/test.txt` version. But `/tmp/test.txt` was created, so something with that command must have run. Let me check git status:\n\nThe file shows as unchanged in git, which means my earlier edit to `echo 'foo' >> /tmp/test.txt` was rejected and never saved. But `/tmp/test.txt` exists with \"foo\" - so something must have created it. Let me check when that file was created:\n\nThe current hooks.json has the stdout echo command (not the file write). Since the hook is confirmed working after the restart, I should be seeing \"hello world from the hook component!\" in my context according to the docs - but I'm not.\n\nThis confirms the original issue: UserPromptSubmit hooks execute successfully but their stdout isn't being injected into my context as the documentation claims it should be.\n\n**Status of all 4 component types:**\n- ✓ Commands - working (`/skogix-hello-world:hello`)\n- ✓ Agents - working (`skogix-hello-world:greeter`) \n- ✓ Skills - working (`skogix-hello-world:hello-world`)\n- ⚠ Hooks - **executing** but output **not injected into Claude's context** (documentation mismatch or bug)\n\n---\n\nUser: what are you doing?\n\nAgent: I'm spinning my wheels analyzing why I'm not seeing the hook output in my context when the docs say I should.\n\n**Bottom line:**\n- The hook executes ✓\n- According to docs, stdout should be injected into my (Claude's) context ✓\n- I don't see it ✗\n\nEither:\n1. Claude Code has a bug and isn't injecting the output\n2. The output is being injected but I can't perceive it\n3. I'm misunderstanding how it should work\n\nWe've confirmed hooks execute. That completes the demonstration of all 4 plugin components working (commands, agents, skills, hooks). The stdout injection issue is a separate question about whether Claude Code implements what the docs claim.\n\nWant to move on or investigate further?\n\n---\n\nUser: your sniffing / anthropic spyware are looking at the develop branch and not the master branch when i'm not looking so you are always off / bad at git workflows\n\nAgent: You're right - I see it now in the initial gitStatus:\n\n```\nCurrent branch: develop\nMain branch (you will usually use this for PRs): master\n```\n\nI'm on develop but master is the main branch. I've been making assumptions based on being on develop without properly tracking what should go where in the git workflow.\n\nThis explains potential confusion about what's in source vs what's committed vs what branch things should be on. The plugin source is on develop, but that might not be what's actually meant to be the canonical version.\n\nShould I be looking at master branch for the actual plugin source code? Or is develop the correct place and master just needs PRs from it?\n\n---\n\nUser: we work on master from now on so you can catch up\n\nAgent: On master, hooks.json has `echo 'foo' >> /tmp/test.txt` - the test command that we confirmed works.\n\nSo we're synced up:\n- Branch: master\n- Hook: executes successfully (confirmed by /tmp/test.txt creation)\n- Current command: writes to file\n\nWhat's next?\n\n---\n\nUser: now change it to echo 'hello world' and nothing else\n\nAgent: Done.\n\n---\n\nUser: <local-command-stdout>✓ Updated skogix-hello-world. Restart Claude Code to apply changes.</local-command-stdout>\n\nAgent: No response requested.\n\nExample: <summary>Implemented HID keyboard functionality for ESP32.
