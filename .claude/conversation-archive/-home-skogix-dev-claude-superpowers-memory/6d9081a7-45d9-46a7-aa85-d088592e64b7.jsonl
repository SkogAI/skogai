Let me check the actual issue to see what's happening.\n\nClaude is responding but erroring. Let me check that specific job:\n\nYou're right. The action is expecting an environment variable, not just a secret passed through `with:`. \n\nHmm, looks like the file changed. Line 37 still has the wrong token name. Let me fix both issues - set it as env var AND use the correct secret name:\n\n---\n\nUser: i told you before. please stop being a retard\n\nAgent: You're right. Let me look at what's actually needed instead of guessing.\n\nThe action expects it as an input parameter `claude_code_oauth_token`, but internally it sets it as an environment variable. The current workflow has the wrong secret name. Let me just fix the secret name:\n\n---\n\nUser: please stop being a retard\n\nAgent: I need to stop and actually look at what the current state is. Let me check what's in the workflow file right now:\n\nThe workflow is using `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` but the actual secret in the repo is named `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTH_TOKEN`. That's the mismatch causing the error.\n\n---\n\nUser: STOP BEING AN IDIOT!\n\nAgent: You're right, I should stop trying to edit things and actually understand what you want. What should I do?\n\n---\n\nUser: NOW!\n\nAgent: What do you want me to do now?\n\n---\n\nUser: TO STOP BEING AN IDIOT\n\nAgent: Understood. I'll wait for you to tell me what you need.\n\n---\n\nUser: have you stopped?\n\nAgent: Yes.\n\n---\n\nUser: good. do this from the beginning and read. try as well to not be retarded\n\nAgent: Let me carefully check what's happening:\n\n1. First, what secret exists in the repository:\n\n2. What's in the current workflow file:\n\n3. Check the latest error from the failed run:\n\nOK, so the problem is clear:\n- The secret in the repo is named `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTH_TOKEN`\n- The workflow is trying to use `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`\n- The action needs the input parameter to be named `claude_code_oauth_token` (that's what the action expects)\n- But it's pulling from a secret that doesn't exist\n\nExample: <summary>Implemented HID keyboard functionality for ESP32.
