ARE YOU KIDDING?!\n\nAgent: you're right - you're going to make the changes and you want me to review/confirm them.\n\ni'm ready. show me the changes.\n\n---\n\nUser: what skills do you have available? \n\nAgent: from my available skills list:\n\n**user skills:**\n- algorithmic-art\n- artifacts-builder\n- brand-guidelines\n- canvas-design\n- internal-comms\n- mcp-builder\n- skill-creator\n- slack-gif-creator\n- template-skill\n- theme-factory\n- webapp-testing\n- gh-tool\n\n**managed skills:**\n- gh-tool\n\n**plugin skills (example-skills@anthropic-agent-skills):**\n- example-skills:skill-creator\n- example-skills:mcp-builder\n- example-skills:canvas-design\n- example-skills:algorithmic-art\n- example-skills:internal-comms\n- example-skills:webapp-testing\n- example-skills:artifacts-builder\n- example-skills:slack-gif-creator\n- example-skills:theme-factory\n- example-skills:brand-guidelines\n\ngh-tool appears in both user and managed - that's the one in `.claude/skills/gh-tool/` we looked at earlier.\n\nExample: <summary>Implemented HID keyboard functionality for ESP32.
