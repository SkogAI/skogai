That skill defines the fundamental RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle. This skill adapts TDD to documentation.\n\n**Official guidance:** For Anthropic's official skill authoring best practices, see anthropic-best-practices.md. This document provides additional patterns and guidelines that complement the TDD-focused approach in this skill.\n\n## What is a Skill?\n\nA **skill** is a reference guide for proven techniques, patterns, or tools. Skills help future Claude instances find and apply effective approaches.\n\n**Skills are:** Reusable techniques, patterns, tools, reference guides\n\n**Skills are NOT:** Narratives about how you solved a problem once\n\n## TDD Mapping for Skills\n\n| TDD Concept | Skill Creation |\n|-------------|----------------|\n| **Test case** | Pressure scenario with subagent |\n| **Production code** | Skill document (SKILL.md) |\n| **Test fails (RED)** | Agent violates rule without skill (baseline) |\n| **Test passes (GREEN)** | Agent complies with skill present |\n| **Refactor** | Close loopholes while maintaining compliance |\n| **Write test first** | Run baseline scenario BEFORE writing skill |\n| **Watch it fail** | Document exact rationalizations agent uses |\n| **Minimal code** | Write skill addressing those specific violations |\n| **Watch it pass** | Verify agent now complies |\n| **Refactor cycle** | Find new rationalizations → plug → re-verify |\n\nThe entire skill creation process follows RED-GREEN-REFACTOR.\n\n## When to Create a Skill\n\n**Create when:**\n- Technique wasn't intuitively obvious to you\n- You'd reference this again across projects\n- Pattern applies broadly (not project-specific)\n- Others would benefit\n\n**Don't create for:**\n- One-off solutions\n- Standard practices well-documented elsewhere\n- Project-specific conventions (put in CLAUDE.md)\n\n## Skill Types\n\n### Technique\nConcrete method with steps to follow (condition-based-waiting, root-cause-tracing)\n\n### Pattern\nWay of thinking about problems (flatten-with-flags, test-invariants)\n\n### Reference\nAPI docs, syntax guides, tool documentation (office docs)\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n\n```\nskills/\n  skill-name/\n    SKILL.md              # Main reference (required)\n    supporting-file.*     # Only if needed\n```\n\n**Flat namespace** - all skills in one searchable namespace\n\n**Separate files for:**\n1. **Heavy reference** (100+ lines) - API docs, comprehensive syntax\n2. **Reusable tools** - Scripts, utilities, templates\n\n**Keep inline:**\n- Principles and concepts\n- Code patterns (< 50 lines)\n- Everything else\n\n## SKILL.md Structure\n\n**Frontmatter (YAML):**\n- Only two fields supported: `name` and `description`\n- Max 1024 characters total\n- `name`: Use letters, numbers, and hyphens only (no parentheses, special chars)\n- `description`: Third-person, includes BOTH what it does AND when to use it\n  - Start with \"Use when...\" to focus on triggering conditions\n  - Include specific symptoms, situations, and contexts\n  - Keep under 500 characters if possible\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: Skill-Name-With-Hyphens\ndescription: Use when [specific triggering conditions and symptoms] - [what the skill does and how it helps, written in third person]\n---\n\n# Skill Name\n\n## Overview\nWhat is this? Core principle in 1-2 sentences.\n\n## When to Use\n[Small inline flowchart IF decision non-obvious]\n\nBullet list with SYMPTOMS and use cases\nWhen NOT to use\n\n## Core Pattern (for techniques/patterns)\nBefore/after code comparison\n\n## Quick Reference\nTable or bullets for scanning common operations\n\n## Implementation\nInline code for simple patterns\nLink to file for heavy reference or reusable tools\n\n## Common Mistakes\nWhat goes wrong + fixes\n\n## Real-World Impact (optional)\nConcrete results\n```\n\n\n## Claude Search Optimization (CSO)\n\n**Critical for discovery:** Future Claude needs to FIND your skill\n\n### 1. Rich Description Field\n\n**Purpose:** Claude reads description to decide which skills to load for a given task. Make it answer: \"Should I read this skill right now?\"\n\n**Format:** Start with \"Use when...\" to focus on triggering conditions, then explain what it does\n\n**Content:**\n- Use concrete triggers, symptoms, and situations that signal this skill applies\n- Describe the *problem* (race conditions, inconsistent behavior) not *language-specific symptoms* (setTimeout, sleep)\n- Keep triggers technology-agnostic unless the skill itself is technology-specific\n- If skill is technology-specific, make that explicit in the trigger\n- Write in third person (injected into system prompt)\n\n```yaml\n# ❌ BAD: Too abstract, vague, doesn't include when to use\ndescription: For async testing\n\n# ❌ BAD: First person\ndescription: I can help you with async tests when they're flaky\n\n# ❌ BAD: Mentions technology but skill isn't specific to it\ndescription: Use when tests use setTimeout/sleep and are flaky\n\n# ✅ GOOD: Starts with \"Use when\", describes problem, then what it does\ndescription: Use when tests have race conditions, timing dependencies, or pass/fail inconsistently - replaces arbitrary timeouts with condition polling for reliable async tests\n\n# ✅ GOOD: Technology-specific skill with explicit trigger\ndescription: Use when using React Router and handling authentication redirects - provides patterns for protected routes and auth state management\n```\n\n### 2. Keyword Coverage\n\nUse words Claude would search for:\n- Error messages: \"Hook timed out\", \"ENOTEMPTY\", \"race condition\"\n- Symptoms: \"flaky\", \"hanging\", \"zombie\", \"pollution\"\n- Synonyms: \"timeout/hang/freeze\", \"cleanup/teardown/afterEach\"\n- Tools: Actual commands, library names, file types\n\n### 3. Descriptive Naming\n\n**Use active voice, verb-first:**\n- ✅ `creating-skills` not `skill-creation`\n- ✅ `testing-skills-with-subagents` not `subagent-skill-testing`\n\n### 4. Token Efficiency (Critical)\n\n**Problem:** getting-started and frequently-referenced skills load into EVERY conversation. Every token counts.\n\n**Target word counts:**\n- getting-started workflows: <150 words each\n- Frequently-loaded skills: <200 words total\n- Other skills: <500 words (still be concise)\n\n**Techniques:**\n\n**Move details to tool help:**\n```bash\n# ❌ BAD: Document all flags in SKILL.md\nsearch-conversations supports --text, --both, --after DATE, --before DATE, --limit N\n\n# ✅ GOOD: Reference --help\nsearch-conversations supports multiple modes and filters. Run --help for details.\n```\n\n**Use cross-references:**\n```markdown\n# ❌ BAD: Repeat workflow details\nWhen searching, dispatch subagent with template...\n[20 lines of repeated instructions]\n\n# ✅ GOOD: Reference other skill\nAlways use subagents (50-100x context savings). REQUIRED: Use [other-skill-name] for workflow.\n```\n\n**Compress examples:**\n```markdown\n# ❌ BAD: Verbose example (42 words)\nyour human partner: \"How did we handle authentication errors in React Router before?\"\nYou: I'll search past conversations for React Router authentication patterns.\n[Dispatch subagent with search query: \"React Router authentication error handling 401\"]\n\n# ✅ GOOD: Minimal example (20 words)\nPartner: \"How did we handle auth errors in React Router?\"\nYou: Searching...\n[Dispatch subagent → synthesis]\n```\n\n**Eliminate redundancy:**\n- Don't repeat what's in cross-referenced skills\n- Don't explain what's obvious from command\n- Don't include multiple examples of same pattern\n\n**Verification:**\n```bash\nwc -w skills/path/SKILL.md\n# getting-started workflows: aim for <150 each\n# Other frequently-loaded: aim for <200 total\n```\n\n**Name by what you DO or core insight:**\n- ✅ `condition-based-waiting` > `async-test-helpers`\n- ✅ `using-skills` not `skill-usage`\n- ✅ `flatten-with-flags` > `data-structure-refactoring`\n- ✅ `root-cause-tracing` > `debugging-techniques`\n\n**Gerunds (-ing) work well for processes:**\n- `creating-skills`, `testing-skills`, `debugging-with-logs`\n- Active, describes the action you're taking\n\n### 4. Cross-Referencing Other Skills\n\n**When writing documentation that references other skills:**\n\nUse skill name only, with explicit requirement markers:\n- ✅ Good: `**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:test-driven-development`\n- ✅ Good: `**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** You MUST understand superpowers:systematic-debugging`\n- ❌ Bad: `See skills/testing/test-driven-development` (unclear if required)\n- ❌ Bad: `@skills/testing/test-driven-development/SKILL.md` (force-loads, burns context)\n\n**Why no @ links:** `@` syntax force-loads files immediately, consuming 200k+ context before you need them.\n\n## Flowchart Usage\n\n```dot\ndigraph when_flowchart {\n    \"Need to show information?\" [shape=diamond];\n    \"Decision where I might go wrong?\" [shape=diamond];\n    \"Use markdown\" [shape=box];\n    \"Small inline flowchart\" [shape=box];\n\n    \"Need to show information?\" -> \"Decision where I might go wrong?\" [label=\"yes\"];\n    \"Decision where I might go wrong?\" -> \"Small inline flowchart\" [label=\"yes\"];\n    \"Decision where I might go wrong?\" -> \"Use markdown\" [label=\"no\"];\n}\n```\n\n**Use flowcharts ONLY for:**\n- Non-obvious decision points\n- Process loops where you might stop too early\n- \"When to use A vs B\" decisions\n\n**Never use flowcharts for:**\n- Reference material → Tables, lists\n- Code examples → Markdown blocks\n- Linear instructions → Numbered lists\n- Labels without semantic meaning (step1, helper2)\n\nSee @graphviz-conventions.dot for graphviz style rules.\n\n## Code Examples\n\n**One excellent example beats many mediocre ones**\n\nChoose most relevant language:\n- Testing techniques → TypeScript/JavaScript\n- System debugging → Shell/Python\n- Data processing → Python\n\n**Good example:**\n- Complete and runnable\n- Well-commented explaining WHY\n- From real scenario\n- Shows pattern clearly\n- Ready to adapt (not generic template)\n\n**Don't:**\n- Implement in 5+ languages\n- Create fill-in-the-blank templates\n- Write contrived examples\n\nYou're good at porting - one great example is enough.\n\n## File Organization\n\n### Self-Contained Skill\n```\ndefense-in-depth/\n  SKILL.md    # Everything inline\n```\nWhen: All content fits, no heavy reference needed\n\n### Skill with Reusable Tool\n```\ncondition-based-waiting/\n  SKILL.md    # Overview + patterns\n  example.ts  # Working helpers to adapt\n```\nWhen: Tool is reusable code, not just narrative\n\n### Skill with Heavy Reference\n```\npptx/\n  SKILL.md       # Overview + workflows\n  pptxgenjs.md   # 600 lines API reference\n  ooxml.md       # 500 lines XML structure\n  scripts/       # Executable tools\n```\nWhen: Reference material too large for inline\n\n## The Iron Law (Same as TDD)\n\n```\nNO SKILL WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST\n```\n\nThis applies to NEW skills AND EDITS to existing skills.\n\nWrite skill before testing? Delete it. Start over.\nEdit skill without testing? Same violation.\n\n**No exceptions:**\n- Not for \"simple additions\"\n- Not for \"just adding a section\"\n- Not for \"documentation updates\"\n- Don't keep untested changes as \"reference\"\n- Don't \"adapt\" while running tests\n- Delete means delete\n\n**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** The superpowers:test-driven-development skill explains why this matters. Same principles apply to documentation.\n\n## Testing All Skill Types\n\nDifferent skill types need different test approaches:\n\n### Discipline-Enforcing Skills (rules/requirements)\n\n**Examples:** TDD, verification-before-completion, designing-before-coding\n\n**Test with:**\n- Academic questions: Do they understand the rules?\n- Pressure scenarios: Do they comply under stress?\n- Multiple pressures combined: time + sunk cost + exhaustion\n- Identify rationalizations and add explicit counters\n\n**Success criteria:** Agent follows rule under maximum pressure\n\n### Technique Skills (how-to guides)\n\n**Examples:** condition-based-waiting, root-cause-tracing, defensive-programming\n\n**Test with:**\n- Application scenarios: Can they apply the technique correctly?\n- Variation scenarios: Do they handle edge cases?\n- Missing information tests: Do instructions have gaps?\n\n**Success criteria:** Agent successfully applies technique to new scenario\n\n### Pattern Skills (mental models)\n\n**Examples:** reducing-complexity, information-hiding concepts\n\n**Test with:**\n- Recognition scenarios: Do they recognize when pattern applies?\n- Application scenarios: Can they use the mental model?\n- Counter-examples: Do they know when NOT to apply?\n\n**Success criteria:** Agent correctly identifies when/how to apply pattern\n\n### Reference Skills (documentation/APIs)\n\n**Examples:** API documentation, command references, library guides\n\n**Test with:**\n- Retrieval scenarios: Can they find the right information?\n- Application scenarios: Can they use what they found correctly?\n- Gap testing: Are common use cases covered?\n\n**Success criteria:** Agent finds and correctly applies reference information\n\n## Common Rationalizations for Skipping Testing\n\n| Excuse | Reality |\n|--------|---------|\n| \"Skill is obviously clear\" | Clear to you ≠ clear to other agents. Test it. |\n| \"It's just a reference\" | References can have gaps, unclear sections. Test retrieval. |\n| \"Testing is overkill\" | Untested skills have issues. Always. 15 min testing saves hours. |\n| \"I'll test if problems emerge\" | Problems = agents can't use skill. Test BEFORE deploying. |\n| \"Too tedious to test\" | Testing is less tedious than debugging bad skill in production. |\n| \"I'm confident it's good\" | Overconfidence guarantees issues. Test anyway. |\n| \"Academic review is enough\" | Reading ≠ using. Test application scenarios. |\n| \"No time to test\" | Deploying untested skill wastes more time fixing it later. |\n\n**All of these mean: Test before deploying. No exceptions.**\n\n## Bulletproofing Skills Against Rationalization\n\nSkills that enforce discipline (like TDD) need to resist rationalization. Agents are smart and will find loopholes when under pressure.\n\n**Psychology note:** Understanding WHY persuasion techniques work helps you apply them systematically. See persuasion-principles.md for research foundation (Cialdini, 2021; Meincke et al., 2025) on authority, commitment, scarcity, social proof, and unity principles.\n\n### Close Every Loophole Explicitly\n\nDon't just state the rule - forbid specific workarounds:\n\n<Bad>\n```markdown\nWrite code before test? Delete it.\n```\n</Bad>\n\n<Good>\n```markdown\nWrite code before test? Delete it. Start over.\n\n**No exceptions:**\n- Don't keep it as \"reference\"\n- Don't \"adapt\" it while writing tests\n- Don't look at it\n- Delete means delete\n```\n</Good>\n\n### Address \"Spirit vs Letter\" Arguments\n\nAdd foundational principle early:\n\n```markdown\n**Violating the letter of the rules is violating the spirit of the rules.**\n```\n\nThis cuts off entire class of \"I'm following the spirit\" rationalizations.\n\n### Build Rationalization Table\n\nCapture rationalizations from baseline testing (see Testing section below). Every excuse agents make goes in the table:\n\n```markdown\n| Excuse | Reality |\n|--------|---------|\n| \"Too simple to test\" | Simple code breaks. Test takes 30 seconds. |\n| \"I'll test after\" | Tests passing immediately prove nothing. |\n| \"Tests after achieve same goals\" | Tests-after = \"what does this do?\" Tests-first = \"what should this do?\" |\n```\n\n### Create Red Flags List\n\nMake it easy for agents to self-check when rationalizing:\n\n```markdown\n## Red Flags - STOP and Start Over\n\n- Code before test\n- \"I already manually tested it\"\n- \"Tests after achieve the same purpose\"\n- \"It's about spirit not ritual\"\n- \"This is different because...\"\n\n**All of these mean: Delete code. Start over with TDD.**\n```\n\n### Update CSO for Violation Symptoms\n\nAdd to description: symptoms of when you're ABOUT to violate the rule:\n\n```yaml\ndescription: use when implementing any feature or bugfix, before writing implementation code\n```\n\n## RED-GREEN-REFACTOR for Skills\n\nFollow the TDD cycle:\n\n### RED: Write Failing Test (Baseline)\n\nRun pressure scenario with subagent WITHOUT the skill. Document exact behavior:\n- What choices did they make?\n- What rationalizations did they use (verbatim)?\n- Which pressures triggered violations?\n\nThis is \"watch the test fail\" - you must see what agents naturally do before writing the skill.\n\n### GREEN: Write Minimal Skill\n\nWrite skill that addresses those specific rationalizations. Don't add extra content for hypothetical cases.\n\nRun same scenarios WITH skill. Agent should now comply.\n\n### REFACTOR: Close Loopholes\n\nAgent found new rationalization? Add explicit counter. Re-test until bulletproof.\n\n**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:testing-skills-with-subagents for the complete testing methodology:\n- How to write pressure scenarios\n- Pressure types (time, sunk cost, authority, exhaustion)\n- Plugging holes systematically\n- Meta-testing techniques\n\n## Anti-Patterns\n\n### ❌ Narrative Example\n\"In session 2025-10-03, we found empty projectDir caused...\"\n**Why bad:** Too specific, not reusable\n\n### ❌ Multi-Language Dilution\nexample-js.js, example-py.py, example-go.go\n**Why bad:** Mediocre quality, maintenance burden\n\n### ❌ Code in Flowcharts\n```dot\nstep1 [label=\"import fs\"];\nstep2 [label=\"read file\"];\n```\n**Why bad:** Can't copy-paste, hard to read\n\n### ❌ Generic Labels\nhelper1, helper2, step3, pattern4\n**Why bad:** Labels should have semantic meaning\n\n## STOP: Before Moving to Next Skill\n\n**After writing ANY skill, you MUST STOP and complete the deployment process.**\n\n**Do NOT:**\n- Create multiple skills in batch without testing each\n- Move to next skill before current one is verified\n- Skip testing because \"batching is more efficient\"\n\n**The deployment checklist below is MANDATORY for EACH skill.**\n\nDeploying untested skills = deploying untested code. It's a violation of quality standards.\n\n## Skill Creation Checklist (TDD Adapted)\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use TodoWrite to create todos for EACH checklist item below.**\n\n**RED Phase - Write Failing Test:**\n- [ ] Create pressure scenarios (3+ combined pressures for discipline skills)\n- [ ] Run scenarios WITHOUT skill - document baseline behavior verbatim\n- [ ] Identify patterns in rationalizations/failures\n\n**GREEN Phase - Write Minimal Skill:**\n- [ ] Name uses only letters, numbers, hyphens (no parentheses/special chars)\n- [ ] YAML frontmatter with only name and description (max 1024 chars)\n- [ ] Description starts with \"Use when...\" and includes specific triggers/symptoms\n- [ ] Description written in third person\n- [ ] Keywords throughout for search (errors, symptoms, tools)\n- [ ] Clear overview with core principle\n- [ ] Address specific baseline failures identified in RED\n- [ ] Code inline OR link to separate file\n- [ ] One excellent example (not multi-language)\n- [ ] Run scenarios WITH skill - verify agents now comply\n\n**REFACTOR Phase - Close Loopholes:**\n- [ ] Identify NEW rationalizations from testing\n- [ ] Add explicit counters (if discipline skill)\n- [ ] Build rationalization table from all test iterations\n- [ ] Create red flags list\n- [ ] Re-test until bulletproof\n\n**Quality Checks:**\n- [ ] Small flowchart only if decision non-obvious\n- [ ] Quick reference table\n- [ ] Common mistakes section\n- [ ] No narrative storytelling\n- [ ] Supporting files only for tools or heavy reference\n\n**Deployment:**\n- [ ] Commit skill to git and push to your fork (if configured)\n- [ ] Consider contributing back via PR (if broadly useful)\n\n## Discovery Workflow\n\nHow future Claude finds your skill:\n\n1. **Encounters problem** (\"tests are flaky\")\n3. **Finds SKILL** (description matches)\n4. **Scans overview** (is this relevant?)\n5. **Reads patterns** (quick reference table)\n6. **Loads example** (only when implementing)\n\n**Optimize for this flow** - put searchable terms early and often.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\n**Creating skills IS TDD for process documentation.**\n\nSame Iron Law: No skill without failing test first.\nSame cycle: RED (baseline) → GREEN (write skill) → REFACTOR (close loopholes).\nSame benefits: Better quality, fewer surprises, bulletproof results.\n\nIf you follow TDD for code, follow it for skills. It's the same discipline applied to documentation.\n\n\nAgent: I'm using the **superpowers:writing-skills** skill to help you create a new skill for learning argc commands.\n\nLet me start by creating a todo list for the TDD-based skill creation process, then explore the argc documentation to understand what we're working with.\n\nLet me also look at existing argc commands in the codebase to understand real-world examples:\n\nPerfect! Now I understand argc well. Let me create pressure scenarios to test what an agent would struggle with when learning argc. I'll use the Task tool to run a baseline test WITHOUT a skill:\n\nGood! The baseline agent did reasonably well with access to docs. Let me try a more challenging pressure scenario with multiple features and time pressure:\n\nNo response requested.\n\n---\n\nUser: please continue\n\nAgent: Let me run a more challenging baseline scenario to identify common struggles:"}]},"uuid":"0b65d2cc-9d32-49f7-bd7c-78730346fa04","timestamp":"2025-11-01T02:42:08.131Z"}
