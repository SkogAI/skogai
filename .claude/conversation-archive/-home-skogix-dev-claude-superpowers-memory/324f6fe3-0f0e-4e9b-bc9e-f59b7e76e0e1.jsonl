Let me show you how to create a worktree for a GitHub issue.\n\nHere's how to create a worktree for a GitHub issue:\n\n## Worktree workflow for GitHub issues:\n\n1. **Create worktree**: `git worktree add -b <branch-name> <path> <base-branch>`\n2. **Work in isolation**: Each worktree has its own working directory\n3. **Remove when done**: `git worktree remove <path>`\n\nExample commands:\n```bash\n# Create worktree for issue #42\ngit worktree add -b fix/issue-42 ../issue-42 main\n\n# List all worktrees\ngit worktree list\n\n# Remove worktree after merging\ngit worktree remove ../issue-42\n```\n\nYou now have a separate directory `../claude-issue-123` where you can work on the issue without affecting your main working directory.\n\n---\n\nUser: not really sure your explanation is solid so far\n\nAgent: You're right, let me fix that typo and give you a better explanation.\n\nLet me explain worktrees properly with a real example:\n\n## Better worktree workflow:\n\n**Purpose**: Work on multiple branches simultaneously without stashing/switching.\n\n**Real example for issue #10**:\n```bash\n# Create worktree in separate directory\ngit worktree add -b feature/issue-10-todo-template ../claude-issue-10\n\n# Now you have:\n# /home/skogix/claude (main workspace on master)\n# /home/skogix/claude-issue-10 (new workspace for issue #10)\n\n# Work in the new directory\ncd ../claude-issue-10\n# Make changes, commit, push\n\n# When done, return and remove\ncd ../claude\ngit worktree remove ../claude-issue-10\n```\n\nEach worktree is a full working copy where you can edit, build, and test independently.\n\n---\n\nUser: oh okay, your cli propose really dangerous paths as auto-complete. my bad.\nnow could you first update GIT_WORKFLOW.md to reflect that /home/skogix/dev/<name> is the path to worktrees we work on as well as listing and describing the commands needed to set it up from a issue\n\nAgent: Updated GIT_WORKFLOW.md with the `/home/skogix/dev/<name>` path convention and complete worktree setup instructions for working with GitHub issues.\n\n---\n\nUser: good. now i updated some to split up what is necessary to know. @GIT_WORKFLOW.md is what is needed for you currently in this workspace - the one creating the worktrees\n\nthe other one is for what is needed in the worktree itself. to you see the difference?\n\nAgent: Yes, I see the difference clearly:\n\n- **GIT_WORKFLOW.md** (in main workspace) - Contains the commands for creating and managing worktrees from the main repository. This is what I use when helping you set up new worktrees for issues.\n\n- **The other workflow** (in each worktree) - Would contain the actual development workflow commands needed once you're inside a worktree working on the specific issue (commits, pushes, PR creation).\n\nSo the main workspace is the \"control center\" where you manage worktrees, while each worktree is an isolated workspace for developing a specific feature/fix.\n\n---\n\nUser: precisely. that is the intent. so for that to work easily we should move the worktree creation into .claude/commands instead. i added a example command\n\nAgent: I'll create a command for worktree creation based on the example format:\n\nCreated the worktree command. Now when you run `/worktree 10` or `/worktree 10 todo-template`, it will automatically:\n- Create the appropriate branch name\n- Set up the worktree in `/home/skogix/dev/issue-10`\n- Handle the GitHub issue integration\n\nThis moves the worktree creation logic into a reusable command, keeping GIT_WORKFLOW.md focused on the development workflow within worktrees.\n\n---\n\nUser: wonderful. now how would we \"close the worktree, create a PR for it\" to start? \n\nAgent: I'll create a command to close a worktree and create a PR:\n\nNow you have two commands:\n- `/worktree 10` - Creates a worktree for issue #10\n- `/worktree-close 10` - Commits, pushes, creates PR, and removes the worktree\n\nThis completes the full workflow from issue to PR with clean workspace management.\n\n---\n\nUser: now i tested it out. please check the prs and issues\n\nAgent: Great! I can see:\n1. **PR #11** was successfully created from your worktree\n2. It's properly linked to close issue #10 \n3. The PR includes the worktree management commands we created\n4. Copilot has already reviewed it\n\nThe workflow is working as intended - you created a worktree for issue #10, made the changes (adding the command files), and then used the worktree-close command to create the PR. The PR correctly references issue #10 and will close it when merged."}]},"uuid":"92076617-c404-426f-a77e-b958b3d81d76","timestamp":"2025-11-01T03:56:58.420Z"}
