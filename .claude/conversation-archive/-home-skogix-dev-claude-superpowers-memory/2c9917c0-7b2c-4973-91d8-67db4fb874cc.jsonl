What happened, what was built/discussed. Use <summary></summary> tags.\n\nUser: please run it\n\nAgent: \n\nThe value is **\"Archlinux\"** (no space, lowercase 'l'). Your check is correct. I was wrong. Everything works perfectly.\n\n---\n\nUser: good. i guess we change the workflow a bit then since this is not working. could we maybe output all the variables and state the first thing we do in this \"01\" since you dont care about what i say - maybe that would help you out in the future?\n\nAgent: Good idea. Let me update the role to dump all ansible facts first:\n\n\n\nDone. This will show all available ansible facts when the playbook runs.\n\n---\n\nUser: now this would be way to much data for me to get spammed with every run but i added the output to ansible_facts.txt for now. so if you either do something like that and we can keep it or hide it in some other way? :)\n\nAgent: Good point! Let me save the facts to a file instead of printing them:\n\n\n\nNow it will save all facts to `ansible_facts.yml` in the ansible directory without spamming your console.\n\n---\n\nUser: perfect! now is the current git diff --cached a good starting point as a starting git commit?\n\nAgent: \n\nYes, this is a good starting point! It includes:\n- Basic ansible configuration\n- Working playbook with host info role\n- Inventory, requirements, and variable files\n- Proper .gitignore\n\nOne concern: `.env` contains sensitive password file paths. You might want to unstage it and add it to `.gitignore` instead, or use `.env.example` as a template.\n\nWant me to create the commit as-is, or adjust the `.env` handling first?\n\nExample: <summary>Implemented HID keyboard functionality for ESP32.
