The agent will:\n- Analyze your request to determine the issue type\n- Generate a comprehensive issue description\n- Suggest appropriate labels and metadata\n- Create the issue in the current repository\n\nUsage examples:\n- `/issue Bug: Application crashes when uploading large files`\n- `/issue Feature request: Add dark mode support`\n- `/issue Document the new API endpoints`\n\nThe agent will guide you through the process and ensure the issue follows best practices.\n\nARGUMENTS: need to add a issue command to claude code\n\nAgent: I'll help you create a GitHub issue for adding an issue command to Claude Code. Let me use the github-issue-creator agent to handle this properly.\n\n---\n\nUser: Create a GitHub issue with the following details:\n\nTitle: \"Add /issue command to Claude Code\"\n\nThe issue should describe the need to implement a new slash command `/issue` that allows users to quickly create GitHub issues from within Claude Code. \n\nKey points to include:\n- This is a feature request for a new slash command\n- The command should integrate with GitHub's API to create issues\n- It should support basic issue creation with title and description\n- Could potentially use an agent to help format and enhance issue descriptions\n- The command definition already exists at .claude/commands/issue.md but needs implementation\n\nPlease analyze the context, generate a comprehensive issue description following best practices, suggest appropriate labels (like \"enhancement\", \"feature-request\"), and create the issue in the current repository (skogix/claude).\n\nReturn the issue URL when complete.\n\nAgent: I'll analyze the repository context and create a comprehensive GitHub issue for the `/issue` command feature request. Let me first examine the existing command definition and repository structure.\n\nNow let me check for any existing similar issues and examine the repository structure to understand the context better.\n\nPerfect! Now I have all the context I need. Let me create a comprehensive GitHub issue based on the analysis:\n\n1. The command definition already exists at `/home/skogix/claude/.claude/commands/issue.md`\n2. There's a corresponding agent definition at `/home/skogix/claude/.claude/agents/github-issue-creator.md`\n3. No existing issues about this feature\n4. This is a fresh repository for Claude integrations being rebuilt\n\nNow I'll create the GitHub issue:\n\nLet me check what labels are available in the repository and create the issue with appropriate labels:\n\nPerfect! Now I'll create the issue with the correct labels:\n\nExcellent! I've successfully created a comprehensive GitHub issue for the `/issue` command feature request. Here's what was accomplished:\n\n## Issue Created Successfully\n\n**Issue URL:** https://github.com/SkogAI/claude/issues/12\n\n**Title:** [FEATURE] Add /issue command to Claude Code\n\n## Key Features of the Issue\n\n1. **Comprehensive Description**: \n   - Clear problem statement explaining the workflow disruption\n   - Detailed proposed solution with specific implementation points\n   - Current state analysis showing what's already available vs. what needs implementation\n\n2. **Structured Content**:\n   - Usage examples demonstrating the command functionality\n   - Success criteria with actionable checkboxes\n   - Implementation considerations for developers\n   - References to existing files that support the feature\n\n3. **Proper Metadata**:\n   - Applied \"enhancement\" label (the closest match to feature-request in this repository)\n   - Used [FEATURE] prefix in title for clear categorization\n   - Included Claude Code attribution\n\n4. **Context Integration**:\n   - Referenced the existing command definition at `/home/skogix/claude/.claude/commands/issue.md`\n   - Mentioned the github-issue-creator agent at `/home/skogix/claude/.claude/agents/github-issue-creator.md`\n   - Linked to the git workflow documentation\n\nThe issue follows GitHub best practices with a clear structure, actionable items, and comprehensive information that will help developers understand both the requirement and implementation approach.\n\nIssue created successfully: https://github.com/SkogAI/claude/issues/12\n\nThe issue includes:\n- Detailed feature request for the `/issue` command\n- Implementation requirements and success criteria  \n- References to existing command definition and agent files\n- Applied \"enhancement\" label for proper categorization"}]},"uuid":"abd59d2f-8eba-40a5-b5a8-146739046ccd","timestamp":"2025-11-01T03:56:44.509Z"}
