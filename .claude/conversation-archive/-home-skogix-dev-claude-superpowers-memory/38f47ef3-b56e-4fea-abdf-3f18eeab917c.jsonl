How can I help you today?\n\n---\n\nUser: tell me about your knowledge about the current git state\n\nAgent: Based on the git status at the start of our conversation, here's the current state:\n\n**Branch:** master (also the main branch)\n\n**Modified files:**\n- `.claude/agents/git-operations-handler.md` (modified)\n\n**Deleted files:**\n- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug.md`\n- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.md`\n- `feature/git-workflow/` directory with multiple files including README, TODO, and 9 issue files\n\n**Untracked files:**\n- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature.md` (new)\n- `GIT_WORKFLOW.md` (new)\n\n**Recent commits:**\n- `e611c9a dump` (latest)\n- `96798a1 Merge branch 'feat/claude-home-setup'`\n- `79d413d Add git operations handler agent configuration`\n\nIt appears you've been restructuring the git workflow documentation and issue templates, moving from a feature branch structure to a more centralized approach with the new `GIT_WORKFLOW.md` file.\n\n---\n\nUser: now how would you use the newly created feature template to create a new feature request?\n\nAgent: I'll use the git operations handler agent to create a new feature request using the newly created template.\n\n---\n\nUser: Create a new GitHub issue using the feature template located at .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature.md. \n\nFirst, read the feature template to understand its structure, then create a new feature request issue. The feature should be about \"Adding automated git workflow validation hooks\" - a system that would automatically validate commits and PRs against the GIT_WORKFLOW.md guidelines.\n\nInclude appropriate details about:\n- The problem it solves (ensuring consistent git workflow adherence)\n- The proposed solution (pre-commit hooks and GitHub Actions)\n- Benefits (reduced manual review effort, consistent code quality)\n\nUse the gh CLI to create the issue with the proper labels and formatting from the template.\n\nAgent: I'll help you create a new GitHub issue using the feature template. Let me first read the template to understand its structure, then create the issue.\n\nNow let me also read the GIT_WORKFLOW.md file to better understand what workflow guidelines need to be validated:\n\nPerfect! Now I have the template structure and understand the workflow guidelines. Let me create the GitHub issue using the gh CLI with the feature template format:\n\nPerfect! I've successfully created the GitHub issue using the feature template. The issue has been created with:\n\n**Issue Details:**\n- **Title**: [FEATURE] Adding automated git workflow validation hooks\n- **URL**: https://github.com/SkogAI/claude/issues/9\n- **Label**: enhancement (as specified in the template)\n\n**Key Components Included:**\n- **Description**: Clear explanation of the automated validation system for git workflow compliance\n- **Requirements**: 8 specific requirements covering pre-commit hooks, GitHub Actions, and integration points\n- **Implementation Notes**: Technical considerations including pre-commit framework, GitHub Actions, and configuration options\n- **Acceptance Criteria**: Comprehensive checklist with 8 criteria ensuring proper implementation and testing\n- **Benefits**: Highlighted advantages including reduced manual review effort, consistent code quality, and improved developer experience\n\nThe issue follows the exact structure from the feature template at `/home/skogix/claude/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature.md` and addresses the specific need for automated git workflow validation against the guidelines in `GIT_WORKFLOW.md`. The issue is now ready for discussion and implementation planning.\n\nThe feature request has been successfully created as [Issue #9](https://github.com/SkogAI/claude/issues/9). It uses the feature template to propose an automated git workflow validation system with pre-commit hooks and GitHub Actions to enforce the guidelines in your `GIT_WORKFLOW.md` file.\n\n---\n\nUser: great! now please use it to create a feature request for .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.md which is a general task/todo template we can use which essentially have subtasks, priority and related issues/feature it belongs to\n\nAgent: I'll use the git operations handler agent to create a feature request for adding a task/todo template.\n\n---\n\nUser: Create a new GitHub issue using the feature template located at .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature.md.\n\nThe feature request should be for \"Task/TODO Issue Template\" - a new issue template that would be saved at .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.md.\n\nThe feature should describe:\n- The need for a structured way to track tasks and todos in GitHub issues\n- Key components: subtasks (with checkboxes), priority levels, related issues/features linkage\n- Benefits: better task organization, clear dependencies, improved project management\n\nInclude requirements like:\n- Checkbox-based subtasks for tracking progress\n- Priority field (High/Medium/Low)\n- Related issues section for linking to parent features or related tasks\n- Estimated time/effort field\n- Assignee and labels configuration\n\nUse the gh CLI to create the issue with proper formatting from the feature template.\n\nAgent: I'll help you create a GitHub issue for the Task/TODO Issue Template feature using the existing feature template. First, let me read the feature template to understand its structure.\n\nNow I'll create the GitHub issue using the feature template structure with the content for the Task/TODO Issue Template feature:\n\nPerfect! I've successfully created GitHub issue #10 for the \"Task/TODO Issue Template\" feature request. The issue has been created with:\n\n**Issue Details:**\n- **Title**: [FEATURE] Task/TODO Issue Template\n- **Label**: enhancement (automatically applied from the feature template)\n- **URL**: https://github.com/SkogAI/claude/issues/10\n\n**Content Included:**\n- **Description**: Clear explanation of the need for a structured task/TODO issue template\n- **Requirements**: 8 specific requirements including template creation, checkbox subtasks, priority fields, related issues linking, time estimation, and testing\n- **Implementation Notes**: Technical details about file location (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.md`), key components, and benefits\n- **Acceptance Criteria**: 6 criteria for completion including template functionality, documentation, and code review\n\nThe issue follows the existing feature template structure and includes all the requested elements such as checkbox-based subtasks, priority levels, related issues linkage, estimated time fields, and assignee configuration. The issue is now ready for discussion and implementation planning.\n\nThe feature request has been successfully created as [Issue #10](https://github.com/SkogAI/claude/issues/10). It proposes adding a new task/TODO template at `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.md` with support for subtasks, priorities, and linking to related issues/features."}]},"uuid":"8e589a47-4838-46f9-9121-d87b7acceeb3","timestamp":"2025-11-01T03:54:48.658Z"}
