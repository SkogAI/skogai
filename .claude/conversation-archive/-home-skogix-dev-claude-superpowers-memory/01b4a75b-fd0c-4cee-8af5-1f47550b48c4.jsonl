The parallel execution patterns and analysis-first philosophy are solid.\n\n**argc usage**: Clean CLI wrapper around git-flow. The `git-flow::*` namespace pattern works well for grouping related commands. Good use of argc's declarative syntax with `@cmd` and `@arg` annotations."}]},"uuid":"6ef10551-61bd-445e-afaf-e1a5a1bacea9","timestamp":"2025-11-01T03:55:39.486Z"}
