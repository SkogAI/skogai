Let me first examine what hooks exist in this directory.\n\n\n\nI can see the hooks are symlinked to your dotfiles. Let me check which hooks are writing logs and update them to use `$HOME/.claude/logs/<session-id>/` instead of the current directory.\n\n---\n\nUser: hello claude. this is the hooks folder in your global claude folder. i'd like to save the logs in .claude/logs/ instead of ./ since that bloats down every project ever :P\n\nAgent: I'll help you move the log storage from the project root to `.claude/logs/`.
