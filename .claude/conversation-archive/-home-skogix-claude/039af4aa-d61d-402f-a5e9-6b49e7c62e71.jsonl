Create GitHub issue with appropriate template\n2. Assign labels (enhancement, bug, task, priority)\n3. Add to project board if using GitHub Projects\n\n### Working on Tasks\n\n1. Create branch from issue: `git checkout -b feature/issue-number-description`\n2. Make atomic commits with clear messages\n3. Reference issue in commits: `Refs #42` or `Closes #42`\n4. Push branch and create PR\n\n### Pull Request Workflow\n\n1. Create PR with description linking to issue\n2. Request reviews\n3. Address feedback\n4. Merge when approved\n\n## Issue Labels\n\n### Type Labels\n\n- `enhancement` - New features\n- `bug` - Bug reports\n- `task` - General tasks\n- `documentation` - Documentation updates\n\n### Priority Labels\n\n- `priority:high` - Urgent items\n- `priority:medium` - Normal priority\n- `priority:low` - Nice to have\n\n### Status Labels\n\n- `in-progress` - Currently being worked on\n- `blocked` - Waiting on dependencies\n- `ready-for-review` - PR ready for review\n\n## Quick Commands\n\n### Create and track issue from CLI\n\n```bash\n# Create issue\ngh issue create --title \"Task title\" --body \"Description\" --label \"task\"\n\n# List open issues\ngh issue list\n\n# Start work on issue\ngh issue develop 42\n```\n\n### Track progress\n\n```bash\n# View project board\ngh project list\n\n# Update issue status\ngh issue edit 42 --add-label \"in-progress\"\n```\n\n## Integration with Local Development\n\nInstead of maintaining separate todo.md files, use:\n\n1. GitHub Issues for task tracking\n2. Commit messages for change documentation\n3. PR descriptions for feature documentation\n4. Issue comments for progress updates\n\nThis creates a single source of truth that's version controlled and collaborative.\n\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":63,"oldLines":18,"newStart":63,"newLines":30,"lines":[" "," ## Task Management with Git"," ","+### Hybrid Local-First Workflow","+","+This workflow uses local markdown files for rapid iteration and planning, then syncs to GitHub Issues as the official source of truth.","+"," ### Creating Tasks"," ","-1.
