The constant self-assessment interrupts flow and clutters output.\n\nI'd suggest keeping it at the orchestration level - activate it contextually when uncertainty genuinely matters rather than as a blanket requirement. Perhaps trigger it with specific keywords or task types rather than enforcing it universally.\n\nThe principle itself is sound - explicit uncertainty is better than false confidence.
