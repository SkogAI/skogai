They enable more efficient problem-solving by providing task-specific configurations with customized system prompts, tools and a separate context window. Subagents are pre-configured AI personalities that Claude Code can delegate tasks to.\n\n### Key Configuration Points for Parallel Work:\n\n1. **Subagent Configuration**: Claude Code supports custom AI subagents that can be configured at both user and project levels. These subagents are stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter: User subagents: ~/.claude/agents/ - Available across all your projects · Project subagents: .claude/agents/ - Specific to your project and can be shared with your team\n\n2. **Context Isolation**: Each subagent operates in its own context, preventing pollution of the main conversation and keeping it focused on high-level objectives. This is crucial for parallel processing as it ensures agents don't interfere with each other.\n\n3. **Tool Configuration**: Subagents can be granted access to any of Claude Code's internal tools. You have two options for configuring tools: Omit the tools field to inherit all tools from the main thread (default), including MCP tools · Specify individual tools as a comma-separated list for more granular control. When the tools field is omitted, subagents inherit all MCP tools available to the main thread.\n\n4. **Git Worktrees for Parallel Sessions**: Each worktree has its own independent file state, making it perfect for parallel Claude Code sessions · Changes made in one worktree won't affect others, preventing Claude instances from interfering with each other · All worktrees share the same Git history and remote connections · For long-running tasks, you can have Claude working in one worktree while you continue development in another\n\n### Configuration Settings:\n\nThe main configuration settings for parallel agents include:\n\n- **Settings files (JSON)**: Settings files (JSON): Configure permissions, environment variables, and tool behavior\n- **Environment variables**: Claude Code supports the following environment variables to control its behavior: All environment variables can also be configured in settings.json. This is useful as a way to automatically set environment variables for each session, or to roll out a set of environment variables for your whole team or organization.\n- **Permission rules**: Permission rules can be configured using /allowed-tools or in permission settings.\n\n### Performance Considerations:\n\nContext efficiency: Agents help preserve main context, enabling longer overall sessions · Latency: Subagents start off with a clean slate each time they are invoked and may add latency as they gather context that they require to do their job effectively.\n\nThe documentation indicates that while Claude Code supports delegation to specialized subagents for parallel task handling, true concurrent execution of multiple agents simultaneously isn't explicitly described.
