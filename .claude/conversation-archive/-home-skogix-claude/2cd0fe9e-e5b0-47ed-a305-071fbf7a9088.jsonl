Generate Comprehensive Issue:**\n```markdown\nTitle: [BUG] CI pipeline fails with TypeError on Node 20 async handlers\n\n## Description\nThe CI pipeline is failing when running tests on Node 20, specifically encountering a TypeError when tests use the new async handlers. This is currently blocking all pull requests from merging.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Create a PR with changes\n2. CI pipeline runs on Node 20\n3. Test suite encounters async handlers\n4. TypeError is thrown\n\n## Expected Behavior\nTests should pass successfully on Node 20 with async handlers\n\n## Actual Behavior\nTypeError thrown causing test suite to fail\n\n## Environment\n- Node version: 20\n- CI Environment: GitHub Actions\n- Affected component: Test suite async handlers\n\n## Impact\n- Severity: High\n- Blocking: All PR merges\n\n## Error Message\n```\nTypeError: [specific error details would be added here]\n```\n\n## Potential Investigation Points\n- [ ] Check Node 20 compatibility with async handler implementation\n- [ ] Review recent changes to async handlers\n- [ ] Verify CI environment configuration\n```\n\n**3. Apply Metadata:**\n- Labels: `bug`, `ci/cd`, `high-priority`, `blocking`\n- Milestone: Current sprint (if applicable)\n- Assignee: CI/DevOps team member (if known)\n\n**4.

Provide Confirmation:**\n- Return issue number (e.g., \"Created issue #42\")\n- Provide direct link to the issue\n- Suggest next steps (e.g., \"Consider notifying the DevOps team\")\n\n## 🎯 Success Metrics:\n\nThe response is successful if it:\n1. ✅ Correctly identifies issue type without being told explicitly\n2. ✅ Extracts all key information from the user's description\n3. ✅ Adds valuable structure/sections the user didn't mention\n4. ✅ Suggests appropriate labels based on content\n5. ✅ Creates a well-formatted, actionable issue\n6. ✅ Returns confirmation with issue URL/number\n\nWant me to test this scenario with the agent to demonstrate?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":4,"cache_creation_input_tokens":305,"cache_read_input_tokens":20362,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":305,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":683,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CT8ifK9F5xvvz2Gkj6uK5","type":"assistant","uuid":"7509ce78-d4d6-4259-9bc0-2c94e939082b","timestamp":"2025-09-14T17:52:42.166Z"}

Having an integrated issue creation command would streamline the process and improve developer productivity.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nAdd a `/issue` command with the following functionality:\n\n- **Command Format**: `/issue <description>`\n- **Integration**: Use the existing github-issue-creator agent to create properly formatted issues\n- **Workflow**: Parse the description argument and generate comprehensive GitHub issues with appropriate formatting and metadata\n\n## Requirements\n\n- [ ] Implement `/issue` slash command parser\n- [ ] Integrate with github-issue-creator agent\n- [ ] Support description argument parsing\n- [ ] Handle error cases (missing description, repository access issues)\n- [ ] Add command documentation\n- [ ] Test command functionality\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- Users can run `/issue \"Fix login bug affecting mobile users\"` and have it create a properly formatted GitHub issue\n- Command validates input and provides helpful error messages\n- Generated issues follow repository issue templates and conventions\n- Command is documented in the available slash commands list\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n- Leverage existing github-issue-creator agent architecture\n- Consider command argument parsing and validation\n- Ensure proper error handling and user feedback\n- Follow established patterns for other slash commands in the codebase\n\n## Benefits\n\n- Seamless issue creation without context switching\n- Consistent issue formatting through agent integration\n- Improved developer workflow efficiency\n- Better integration between Claude Code and GitHub issue tracking\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)</bash-stdout><bash-stderr></bash-stderr>"},"uuid":"17bbdec9-6503-4eb6-b3a1-ef5b1066b6e0","timestamp":"2025-09-14T18:13:37.601Z"}

What does the @ symbol trigger in Claude Code?\n\nThe `@` symbol in Claude Code serves as a **file reference mechanism** rather than a direct agent invocation. From the evidence found in the codebase:\n\n- In `/home/skogix/claude/CLAUDE.md`: `@docs/git.md is our current git workflow`\n- In `/home/skogix/claude/.claude/agents/git-operations-handler.md`: `The workflow this agent follows is documented in @GIT_WORKFLOW.md`\n- In `/home/skogix/.claude/CLAUDE.md`: `the users todo list is found at @/home/skogix/skogix/todo.md`\n\nThe `@` symbol appears to tell Claude Code to **read and include the content** of the referenced file as context for the current conversation.\n\n### 2. How does @agent-name differ from using /command?\n\nFrom analyzing the codebase structure, there are clear differences:\n\n**Commands (`/command`):**\n- Defined in `/home/skogix/claude/.claude/commands/` directory\n- Have specific execution steps and allowed tools\n- Example: `/issue <description>` which creates GitHub issues\n- Commands translate user input into agent calls (as noted in `/home/skogix/claude/docs/commands.md`)\n\n**Agent References (`@agent-name`):**\n- When you use `@agent-general-purpose`, Claude Code likely resolves this to the file path `/home/skogix/claude/.claude/agents/agent-general-purpose.md`\n- This loads the agent's configuration, system prompt, and capabilities as context\n- The agent doesn't execute immediately but provides Claude with specialized knowledge and instructions\n\n### 3. What context or tools does the agent receive when invoked with @?\n\nWhen you use `@agent-name`, Claude Code:\n\n1. **Loads Agent Configuration**: Reads the agent's markdown file from `.claude/agents/`\n2. **Parses YAML Frontmatter**: Extracts metadata like:\n   - `name`: Agent identifier\n   - `description`: When to use the agent  \n   - `tools`: Available tools (e.g., `Read`, `Bash(git:*)`, `Bash(gh:*)`)\n   - `model`: Preferred model (e.g., `opus`, `sonnet`)\n   - `color`: UI display color\n3. **Applies System Prompt**: The markdown content becomes the system prompt, giving Claude specialized knowledge and behavioral instructions\n4. **Tool Access**: The agent receives access to the specific tools defined in its configuration\n\n### 4. Is this a direct agent invocation or something else?\n\n**It's a context injection mechanism**, not direct execution.
