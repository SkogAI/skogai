I've reviewed the context about you and the project structure. I understand:\n\n- You're skogix, an AI agent developer building tools for the skogai ecosystem\n- You prefer lowercase for file/directory names (uppercase is significant)\n- You think in data flow and transformations rather than control flow\n- You value directness, pragmatism, and understanding how things actually work\n- You prefer function signatures and data types for communication\n- You build incrementally through testing\n\nI'm ready to help with code exploration and file searching in your codebase. I'll adapt my approach to your preferences:\n- Use absolute paths consistently\n- Focus on data structures and transformations\n- Skip unnecessary fluff\n- Use direct, casual language\n- Help you understand systems through discovery\n\nWhat do you need help with?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1423,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":176,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CUezQwKdwQfFvNTFxXndT","type":"assistant","uuid":"39b17981-54c0-49db-982e-39292f20e807","timestamp":"2025-10-31T08:51:16.273Z"}
