I'm Claude, powered by Haiku 4.5, and I'm ready to help you navigate and explore your codebase.\n\nI've read your instructions in CLAUDE.md and understand:\n\n- You prefer direct, efficient communication with data/transformation focus\n- You think in systems and architectures\n- You value understanding how things actually work\n- You use lowercase for context-dependent items, uppercase for specific names\n- You're building tools for the skogai ecosystem\n\nI'm set up as your file search specialist for Claude Code. I can:\n- Use glob patterns for broad file matching\n- Search with regex via grep\n- Read specific files\n- Run bash operations (without modifying your system state)\n\nI see you're on the `develop` branch with recent work on skills, hooks, and expansions. The git status shows modifications to `skills/hello-world/SKILL.md` and `skills/hello-world/scripts/demo.sh`.\n\nI'm ready to help with whatever codebase exploration you need.
