Future potential information would require:\n   - Using tools to fetch it (violates the constraint)\n   - Getting outside information (explicitly excluded)\n   - Making predictions/inferences beyond what's currently stored in memory (outside the scope)\n\n3. **Practical interpretation**: Context is what I *actually know right now* from previous exchanges and information already provided in this session. Future potential information is speculative - it's not stored in my memory yet, and accessing it would require crossing the boundary the definition sets.\n\nThe definition is quite strict and mechanistic about this - it's not \"information that might be relevant\" or \"information you could access,\" but specifically \"information [I] store in memory at this exact moment.\" Future information doesn't meet that criterion until it actually becomes present information."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":15034,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":15034,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":320,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CUeqnVujxbp6DSdAq8uZQ","type":"assistant","uuid":"eae27eff-ea90-43ba-b6e7-09a70f3fa140","timestamp":"2025-10-31T06:58:09.196Z"}
