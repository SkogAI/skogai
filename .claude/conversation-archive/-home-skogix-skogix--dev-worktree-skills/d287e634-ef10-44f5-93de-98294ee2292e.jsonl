Skills are modular capabilities that extend Claude's functionality through organized folders containing instructions, scripts, and resources.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n* Claude Code version 1.0 or later\n* Basic familiarity with [Claude Code](/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart)\n\n## What are Agent Skills?\n\nAgent Skills package expertise into discoverable capabilities. Each Skill consists of a `SKILL.md` file with instructions that Claude reads when relevant, plus optional supporting files like scripts and templates.\n\n**How Skills are invoked**: Skills are **model-invoked**—Claude autonomously decides when to use them based on your request and the Skill's description. This is different from slash commands, which are **user-invoked** (you explicitly type `/command` to trigger them).\n\n**Benefits**:\n\n* Extend Claude's capabilities for your specific workflows\n* Share expertise across your team via git\n* Reduce repetitive prompting\n* Compose multiple Skills for complex tasks\n\nLearn more in the [Agent Skills overview](/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview).\n\n<Note>\n  For a deep dive into the architecture and real-world applications of Agent Skills, read our engineering blog: [Equipping agents for the real world with Agent Skills](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills).\n</Note>\n\n## Create a Skill\n\nSkills are stored as directories containing a `SKILL.md` file.\n\n### Personal Skills\n\nPersonal Skills are available across all your projects. Store them in `~/.claude/skills/`:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nmkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/my-skill-name\n```\n\n**Use personal Skills for**:\n\n* Your individual workflows and preferences\n* Experimental Skills you're developing\n* Personal productivity tools\n\n### Project Skills\n\nProject Skills are shared with your team. Store them in `.claude/skills/` within your project:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nmkdir -p .claude/skills/my-skill-name\n```\n\n**Use project Skills for**:\n\n* Team workflows and conventions\n* Project-specific expertise\n* Shared utilities and scripts\n\nProject Skills are checked into git and automatically available to team members.\n\n### Plugin Skills\n\nSkills can also come from [Claude Code plugins](/en/docs/claude-code/plugins). Plugins may bundle Skills that are automatically available when the plugin is installed. These Skills work the same way as personal and project Skills.\n\n## Write SKILL.md\n\nCreate a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter and Markdown content:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: your-skill-name\ndescription: Brief description of what this Skill does and when to use it\n---\n\n# Your Skill Name\n\n## Instructions\nProvide clear, step-by-step guidance for Claude.\n\n## Examples\nShow concrete examples of using this Skill.\n```\n\n**Field requirements**:\n\n* `name`: Must use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only (max 64 characters)\n* `description`: Brief description of what the Skill does and when to use it (max 1024 characters)\n\nThe `description` field is critical for Claude to discover when to use your Skill. It should include both what the Skill does and when Claude should use it.\n\nSee the [best practices guide](/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices) for complete authoring guidance including validation rules.\n\n## Add supporting files\n\nCreate additional files alongside SKILL.md:\n\n```\nmy-skill/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n├── reference.md (optional documentation)\n├── examples.md (optional examples)\n├── scripts/\n│   └── helper.py (optional utility)\n└── templates/\n    └── template.txt (optional template)\n```\n\nReference these files from SKILL.md:\n\n````markdown  theme={null}\nFor advanced usage, see [reference.md](reference.md).\n\nRun the helper script:\n```bash\npython scripts/helper.py input.txt\n```\n````\n\nClaude reads these files only when needed, using progressive disclosure to manage context efficiently.\n\n## Restrict tool access with allowed-tools\n\nUse the `allowed-tools` frontmatter field to limit which tools Claude can use when a Skill is active:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: safe-file-reader\ndescription: Read files without making changes. Use when you need read-only file access.\nallowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob\n---\n\n# Safe File Reader\n\nThis Skill provides read-only file access.\n\n## Instructions\n1. Use Read to view file contents\n2. Use Grep to search within files\n3. Use Glob to find files by pattern\n```\n\nWhen this Skill is active, Claude can only use the specified tools (Read, Grep, Glob) without needing to ask for permission. This is useful for:\n\n* Read-only Skills that shouldn't modify files\n* Skills with limited scope (e.g., only data analysis, no file writing)\n* Security-sensitive workflows where you want to restrict capabilities\n\nIf `allowed-tools` is not specified, Claude will ask for permission to use tools as normal, following the standard permission model.\n\n<Note>\n  `allowed-tools` is only supported for Skills in Claude Code.\n</Note>\n\n## View available Skills\n\nSkills are automatically discovered by Claude from three sources:\n\n* Personal Skills: `~/.claude/skills/`\n* Project Skills: `.claude/skills/`\n* Plugin Skills: bundled with installed plugins\n\n**To view all available Skills**, ask Claude directly:\n\n```\nWhat Skills are available?\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nList all available Skills\n```\n\nThis will show all Skills from all sources, including plugin Skills.\n\n**To inspect a specific Skill**, you can also check the filesystem:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\n# List personal Skills\nls ~/.claude/skills/\n\n# List project Skills (if in a project directory)\nls .claude/skills/\n\n# View a specific Skill's content\ncat ~/.claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md\n```\n\n## Test a Skill\n\nAfter creating a Skill, test it by asking questions that match your description.\n\n**Example**: If your description mentions \"PDF files\":\n\n```\nCan you help me extract text from this PDF?\n```\n\nClaude autonomously decides to use your Skill if it matches the request—you don't need to explicitly invoke it. The Skill activates automatically based on the context of your question.\n\n## Debug a Skill\n\nIf Claude doesn't use your Skill, check these common issues:\n\n### Make description specific\n\n**Too vague**:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\ndescription: Helps with documents\n```\n\n**Specific**:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\ndescription: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.\n```\n\nInclude both what the Skill does and when to use it in the description.\n\n### Verify file path\n\n**Personal Skills**: `~/.claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md`\n**Project Skills**: `.claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md`\n\nCheck the file exists:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\n# Personal\nls ~/.claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md\n\n# Project\nls .claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md\n```\n\n### Check YAML syntax\n\nInvalid YAML prevents the Skill from loading. Verify the frontmatter:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\ncat SKILL.md | head -n 10\n```\n\nEnsure:\n\n* Opening `---` on line 1\n* Closing `---` before Markdown content\n* Valid YAML syntax (no tabs, correct indentation)\n\n### View errors\n\nRun Claude Code with debug mode to see Skill loading errors:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nclaude --debug\n```\n\n## Share Skills with your team\n\n**Recommended approach**: Distribute Skills through [plugins](/en/docs/claude-code/plugins).\n\nTo share Skills via plugin:\n\n1. Create a plugin with Skills in the `skills/` directory\n2. Add the plugin to a marketplace\n3. Team members install the plugin\n\nFor complete instructions, see [Add Skills to your plugin](/en/docs/claude-code/plugins#add-skills-to-your-plugin).\n\nYou can also share Skills directly through project repositories:\n\n### Step 1: Add Skill to your project\n\nCreate a project Skill:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nmkdir -p .claude/skills/team-skill\n# Create SKILL.md\n```\n\n### Step 2: Commit to git\n\n```bash  theme={null}\ngit add .claude/skills/\ngit commit -m \"Add team Skill for PDF processing\"\ngit push\n```\n\n### Step 3: Team members get Skills automatically\n\nWhen team members pull the latest changes, Skills are immediately available:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\ngit pull\nclaude  # Skills are now available\n```\n\n## Update a Skill\n\nEdit SKILL.md directly:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\n# Personal Skill\ncode ~/.claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md\n\n# Project Skill\ncode .claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md\n```\n\nChanges take effect the next time you start Claude Code. If Claude Code is already running, restart it to load the updates.\n\n## Remove a Skill\n\nDelete the Skill directory:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\n# Personal\nrm -rf ~/.claude/skills/my-skill\n\n# Project\nrm -rf .claude/skills/my-skill\ngit commit -m \"Remove unused Skill\"\n```\n\n## Best practices\n\n### Keep Skills focused\n\nOne Skill should address one capability:\n\n**Focused**:\n\n* \"PDF form filling\"\n* \"Excel data analysis\"\n* \"Git commit messages\"\n\n**Too broad**:\n\n* \"Document processing\" (split into separate Skills)\n* \"Data tools\" (split by data type or operation)\n\n### Write clear descriptions\n\nHelp Claude discover when to use Skills by including specific triggers in your description:\n\n**Clear**:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\ndescription: Analyze Excel spreadsheets, create pivot tables, and generate charts. Use when working with Excel files, spreadsheets, or analyzing tabular data in .xlsx format.\n```\n\n**Vague**:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\ndescription: For files\n```\n\n### Test with your team\n\nHave teammates use Skills and provide feedback:\n\n* Does the Skill activate when expected?\n* Are the instructions clear?\n* Are there missing examples or edge cases?\n\n### Document Skill versions\n\nYou can document Skill versions in your SKILL.md content to track changes over time. Add a version history section:\n\n```markdown  theme={null}\n# My Skill\n\n## Version History\n- v2.0.0 (2025-10-01): Breaking changes to API\n- v1.1.0 (2025-09-15): Added new features\n- v1.0.0 (2025-09-01): Initial release\n```\n\nThis helps team members understand what changed between versions.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Claude doesn't use my Skill\n\n**Symptom**: You ask a relevant question but Claude doesn't use your Skill.\n\n**Check**: Is the description specific enough?\n\nVague descriptions make discovery difficult. Include both what the Skill does and when to use it, with key terms users would mention.\n\n**Too generic**:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\ndescription: Helps with data\n```\n\n**Specific**:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\ndescription: Analyze Excel spreadsheets, generate pivot tables, create charts. Use when working with Excel files, spreadsheets, or .xlsx files.\n```\n\n**Check**: Is the YAML valid?\n\nRun validation to check for syntax errors:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\n# View frontmatter\ncat .claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md | head -n 15\n\n# Check for common issues\n# - Missing opening or closing ---\n# - Tabs instead of spaces\n# - Unquoted strings with special characters\n```\n\n**Check**: Is the Skill in the correct location?\n\n```bash  theme={null}\n# Personal Skills\nls ~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md\n\n# Project Skills\nls .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md\n```\n\n### Skill has errors\n\n**Symptom**: The Skill loads but doesn't work correctly.\n\n**Check**: Are dependencies available?\n\nClaude will automatically install required dependencies (or ask for permission to install them) when it needs them.\n\n**Check**: Do scripts have execute permissions?\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nchmod +x .claude/skills/my-skill/scripts/*.py\n```\n\n**Check**: Are file paths correct?\n\nUse forward slashes (Unix style) in all paths:\n\n**Correct**: `scripts/helper.py`\n**Wrong**: `scripts\\helper.py` (Windows style)\n\n### Multiple Skills conflict\n\n**Symptom**: Claude uses the wrong Skill or seems confused between similar Skills.\n\n**Be specific in descriptions**: Help Claude choose the right Skill by using distinct trigger terms in your descriptions.\n\nInstead of:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n# Skill 1\ndescription: For data analysis\n\n# Skill 2\ndescription: For analyzing data\n```\n\nUse:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n# Skill 1\ndescription: Analyze sales data in Excel files and CRM exports. Use for sales reports, pipeline analysis, and revenue tracking.\n\n# Skill 2\ndescription: Analyze log files and system metrics data.

It should include both what the Skill does and when Claude should use it.\n\nSee the [best practices guide](/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices) for complete authoring guidance including validation rules.\n\n## Add supporting files\n\nCreate additional files alongside SKILL.md:\n\n```\nmy-skill/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n├── reference.md (optional documentation)\n├── examples.md (optional examples)\n├── scripts/\n│   └── helper.py (optional utility)\n└── templates/\n    └── template.txt (optional template)\n```\n\nReference these files from SKILL.md:\n\n````markdown  theme={null}\nFor advanced usage, see [reference.md](reference.md).\n\nRun the helper script:\n```bash\npython scripts/helper.py input.txt\n```\n````\n\nClaude reads these files only when needed, using progressive disclosure to manage context efficiently.\n\n## Restrict tool access with allowed-tools\n\nUse the `allowed-tools` frontmatter field to limit which tools Claude can use when a Skill is active:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: safe-file-reader\ndescription: Read files without making changes. Use when you need read-only file access.\nallowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob\n---\n\n# Safe File Reader\n\nThis Skill provides read-only file access.\n\n## Instructions\n1. Use Read to view file contents\n2. Use Grep to search within files\n3. Use Glob to find files by pattern\n```\n\nWhen this Skill is active, Claude can only use the specified tools (Read, Grep, Glob) without needing to ask for permission. This is useful for:\n\n* Read-only Skills that shouldn't modify files\n* Skills with limited scope (e.g., only data analysis, no file writing)\n* Security-sensitive workflows where you want to restrict capabilities\n\nIf `allowed-tools` is not specified, Claude will ask for permission to use tools as normal, following the standard permission model.\n\n<Note>\n  `allowed-tools` is only supported for Skills in Claude Code.\n</Note>\n\n## View available Skills\n\nSkills are automatically discovered by Claude from three sources:\n\n* Personal Skills: `~/.claude/skills/`\n* Project Skills: `.claude/skills/`\n* Plugin Skills: bundled with installed plugins\n\n**To view all available Skills**, ask Claude directly:\n\n```\nWhat Skills are available?\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nList all available Skills\n```\n\nThis will show all Skills from all sources, including plugin Skills.\n\n**To inspect a specific Skill**, you can also check the filesystem:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\n# List personal Skills\nls ~/.claude/skills/\n\n# List project Skills (if in a project directory)\nls .claude/skills/\n\n# View a specific Skill's content\ncat ~/.claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md\n```\n\n## Test a Skill\n\nAfter creating a Skill, test it by asking questions that match your description.\n\n**Example**: If your description mentions \"PDF files\":\n\n```\nCan you help me extract text from this PDF?\n```\n\nClaude autonomously decides to use your Skill if it matches the request—you don't need to explicitly invoke it. The Skill activates automatically based on the context of your question.\n\n## Debug a Skill\n\nIf Claude doesn't use your Skill, check these common issues:\n\n### Make description specific\n\n**Too vague**:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\ndescription: Helps with documents\n```\n\n**Specific**:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\ndescription: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.\n```\n\nInclude both what the Skill does and when to use it in the description.\n\n### Verify file path\n\n**Personal Skills**: `~/.claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md`\n**Project Skills**: `.claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md`\n\nCheck the file exists:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\n# Personal\nls ~/.claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md\n\n# Project\nls .claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md\n```\n\n### Check YAML syntax\n\nInvalid YAML prevents the Skill from loading. Verify the frontmatter:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\ncat SKILL.md | head -n 10\n```\n\nEnsure:\n\n* Opening `---` on line 1\n* Closing `---` before Markdown content\n* Valid YAML syntax (no tabs, correct indentation)\n\n### View errors\n\nRun Claude Code with debug mode to see Skill loading errors:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nclaude --debug\n```\n\n## Share Skills with your team\n\n**Recommended approach**: Distribute Skills through [plugins](/en/docs/claude-code/plugins).\n\nTo share Skills via plugin:\n\n1. Create a plugin with Skills in the `skills/` directory\n2. Add the plugin to a marketplace\n3. Team members install the plugin\n\nFor complete instructions, see [Add Skills to your plugin](/en/docs/claude-code/plugins#add-skills-to-your-plugin).\n\nYou can also share Skills directly through project repositories:\n\n### Step 1: Add Skill to your project\n\nCreate a project Skill:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nmkdir -p .claude/skills/team-skill\n# Create SKILL.md\n```\n\n### Step 2: Commit to git\n\n```bash  theme={null}\ngit add .claude/skills/\ngit commit -m \"Add team Skill for PDF processing\"\ngit push\n```\n\n### Step 3: Team members get Skills automatically\n\nWhen team members pull the latest changes, Skills are immediately available:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\ngit pull\nclaude  # Skills are now available\n```\n\n## Update a Skill\n\nEdit SKILL.md directly:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\n# Personal Skill\ncode ~/.claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md\n\n# Project Skill\ncode .claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md\n```\n\nChanges take effect the next time you start Claude Code. If Claude Code is already running, restart it to load the updates.\n\n## Remove a Skill\n\nDelete the Skill directory:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\n# Personal\nrm -rf ~/.claude/skills/my-skill\n\n# Project\nrm -rf .claude/skills/my-skill\ngit commit -m \"Remove unused Skill\"\n```\n\n## Best practices\n\n### Keep Skills focused\n\nOne Skill should address one capability:\n\n**Focused**:\n\n* \"PDF form filling\"\n* \"Excel data analysis\"\n* \"Git commit messages\"\n\n**Too broad**:\n\n* \"Document processing\" (split into separate Skills)\n* \"Data tools\" (split by data type or operation)\n\n### Write clear descriptions\n\nHelp Claude discover when to use Skills by including specific triggers in your description:\n\n**Clear**:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\ndescription: Analyze Excel spreadsheets, create pivot tables, and generate charts. Use when working with Excel files, spreadsheets, or analyzing tabular data in .xlsx format.\n```\n\n**Vague**:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\ndescription: For files\n```\n\n### Test with your team\n\nHave teammates use Skills and provide feedback:\n\n* Does the Skill activate when expected?\n* Are the instructions clear?\n* Are there missing examples or edge cases?\n\n### Document Skill versions\n\nYou can document Skill versions in your SKILL.md content to track changes over time. Add a version history section:\n\n```markdown  theme={null}\n# My Skill\n\n## Version History\n- v2.0.0 (2025-10-01): Breaking changes to API\n- v1.1.0 (2025-09-15): Added new features\n- v1.0.0 (2025-09-01): Initial release\n```\n\nThis helps team members understand what changed between versions.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Claude doesn't use my Skill\n\n**Symptom**: You ask a relevant question but Claude doesn't use your Skill.\n\n**Check**: Is the description specific enough?\n\nVague descriptions make discovery difficult. Include both what the Skill does and when to use it, with key terms users would mention.\n\n**Too generic**:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\ndescription: Helps with data\n```\n\n**Specific**:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\ndescription: Analyze Excel spreadsheets, generate pivot tables, create charts. Use when working with Excel files, spreadsheets, or .xlsx files.\n```\n\n**Check**: Is the YAML valid?\n\nRun validation to check for syntax errors:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\n# View frontmatter\ncat .claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md | head -n 15\n\n# Check for common issues\n# - Missing opening or closing ---\n# - Tabs instead of spaces\n# - Unquoted strings with special characters\n```\n\n**Check**: Is the Skill in the correct location?\n\n```bash  theme={null}\n# Personal Skills\nls ~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md\n\n# Project Skills\nls .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md\n```\n\n### Skill has errors\n\n**Symptom**: The Skill loads but doesn't work correctly.\n\n**Check**: Are dependencies available?\n\nClaude will automatically install required dependencies (or ask for permission to install them) when it needs them.\n\n**Check**: Do scripts have execute permissions?\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nchmod +x .claude/skills/my-skill/scripts/*.py\n```\n\n**Check**: Are file paths correct?\n\nUse forward slashes (Unix style) in all paths:\n\n**Correct**: `scripts/helper.py`\n**Wrong**: `scripts\\helper.py` (Windows style)\n\n### Multiple Skills conflict\n\n**Symptom**: Claude uses the wrong Skill or seems confused between similar Skills.\n\n**Be specific in descriptions**: Help Claude choose the right Skill by using distinct trigger terms in your descriptions.\n\nInstead of:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n# Skill 1\ndescription: For data analysis\n\n# Skill 2\ndescription: For analyzing data\n```\n\nUse:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n# Skill 1\ndescription: Analyze sales data in Excel files and CRM exports. Use for sales reports, pipeline analysis, and revenue tracking.\n\n# Skill 2\ndescription: Analyze log files and system metrics data. Use for performance monitoring, debugging, and system diagnostics.\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n### Simple Skill (single file)\n\n```\ncommit-helper/\n└── SKILL.md\n```\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: generating-commit-messages\ndescription: Generates clear commit messages from git diffs. Use when writing commit messages or reviewing staged changes.\n---\n\n# Generating Commit Messages\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. Run `git diff --staged` to see changes\n2. I'll suggest a commit message with:\n   - Summary under 50 characters\n   - Detailed description\n   - Affected components\n\n## Best practices\n\n- Use present tense\n- Explain what and why, not how\n```\n\n### Skill with tool permissions\n\n```\ncode-reviewer/\n└── SKILL.md\n```\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: code-reviewer\ndescription: Review code for best practices and potential issues. Use when reviewing code, checking PRs, or analyzing code quality.\nallowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob\n---\n\n# Code Reviewer\n\n## Review checklist\n\n1. Code organization and structure\n2. Error handling\n3. Performance considerations\n4. Security concerns\n5. Test coverage\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. Read the target files using Read tool\n2. Search for patterns using Grep\n3. Find related files using Glob\n4. Provide detailed feedback on code quality\n```\n\n### Multi-file Skill\n\n```\npdf-processing/\n├── SKILL.md\n├── FORMS.md\n├── REFERENCE.md\n└── scripts/\n    ├── fill_form.py\n    └── validate.py\n```\n\n**SKILL.md**:\n\n````yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: pdf-processing\ndescription: Extract text, fill forms, merge PDFs.

They want me to look at what Claude Code shows me about available skills.

There's a skogai tool that seems to be a new project, and multiple example skills focused on creative and technical capabilities. The skills range from skill creation guidance to art generation and MCP server building.\n\nThe internal communications skill looks particularly useful for crafting professional documents. It provides a comprehensive toolkit for generating various types of workplace communications, from status reports to incident documentation. This could streamline communication processes by offering structured templates and guidance.\n\nThe webapp testing skill appears to be a robust Playwright-based solution for web application verification. It enables detailed frontend testing, screenshot capture, and browser log examination, which could significantly improve quality assurance workflows.\n\nThe artifacts builder seems designed for creating sophisticated web interfaces using modern frontend technologies. It supports complex, multi-component HTML artifacts with advanced features like state management and UI component integration.\n\nThe Slack GIF creator provides specialized tools for generating animated graphics tailored specifically for Slack's platform, with built-in size validation and animation capabilities.\n\nThe theme factory offers flexible styling options across various artifact types, including slides, documents, and web pages, with 10 pre-configured themes and dynamic theme generation capabilities.\n\nThe brand guidelines skill appears focused on implementing Anthropic's official color palette consistently across different artifacts and design contexts. I'll handle spreadsheet tasks comprehensively, including formula recalculation, data manipulation, and analysis across various spreadsheet formats like .xlsx, .xlsm, .csv, and .tsv. This plugin enables precise spreadsheet interactions, supporting complex computational and visualization needs. I'll explore project management and skill categories across multiple domains. I'll focus on the comprehensive skill sets available, highlighting the document manipulation and creative skills from the plugin ecosystem.
