Adding conditional checks to the project file to only use `TransformXml` when the required assembly exists\n2. This allows the build to skip Web.config transformation on Linux/Mono while still working on Windows\n\n**Additional issue fixed:**\n- Renamed `models` directory to `Models` to match the case-sensitive Linux filesystem\n\nThe project should now build successfully on Linux with Mono, though you'll still see warnings about missing dependencies that are Windows-specific (like PresentationCore, System.Web.Entity)."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":288,"cache_read_input_tokens":83045,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":288,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CTWpjMuLA8vw6c7HRxwdy","type":"assistant","uuid":"ce6546a6-9d97-4e33-87da-8930e03d6e29","timestamp":"2025-09-26T10:05:10.679Z"}
