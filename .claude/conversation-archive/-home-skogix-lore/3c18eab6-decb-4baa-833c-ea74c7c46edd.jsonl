Use the orchestrator agent to:\n   - Synthesize findings from research\n   - Structure the issue according to GitHub best practices\n   - Ensure alignment with project goals\n\n3. Create the issue with:\n   - Clear, descriptive title\n   - Problem statement or feature description\n   - Context from documentation research\n   - Acceptance criteria or expected behavior\n   - Technical details if applicable\n   - Related issues or PRs if found\n\n## Instructions for Claude\n\n1. Launch researcher agent to investigate:\n   - Existing documentation about the topic\n   - Similar issues in the repository\n   - Code patterns or implementations related to the request\n\n2. Based on research, draft a comprehensive issue that includes:\n   - **Title**: Concise and descriptive\n   - **Description**: Clear problem/feature statement\n   - **Context**: Reference to relevant documentation or code\n   - **Acceptance Criteria**: What defines \"done\"\n   - **Technical Notes**: Implementation considerations if applicable\n\n3. Use `gh issue create` to submit the issue with proper formatting\n\nThe issue should be well-researched and reference existing project documentation to maintain consistency with the codebase."}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"16b1717b-14e2-4c24-8009-0f2ad4464ea6","timestamp":"2025-09-25T15:23:21.649Z"}

--value shell\n```\n\n#### `skogcli config --reset`\nResets configuration to default values with confirmation.\n\n## Development Guidelines\n\n### Test-Driven Development (TDD)\n1. **Always write tests first** - Non-negotiable requirement\n2. **No source code modification** without corresponding tests\n3. **Tests as specifications** - Validate documented behaviors precisely\n4. **Red-Green-Refactor cycle** - Write failing tests, implement, refactor\n\n### Documentation-Driven Design (DDD)\n1. **Documentation guides implementation** - Follow docs for requirements\n2. **Document before implementing** - New features need documentation first\n3. **Documentation as source of truth** - Primary reference for behavior\n\n### Code Standards\n- **Type hints**: Comprehensive typing throughout codebase\n- **Error handling**: Appropriate exception types with context\n- **Import organization**: Standard lib → third-party → local\n- **String formatting**: Use f-strings consistently\n- **Docstrings**: All public functions and classes\n\n### Testing Standards\n- **Framework**: pytest with typer.testing.CliRunner\n- **Coverage**: Verify exit codes and stdout content\n- **Test organization**: One test file per module\n- **Naming**: Descriptive test function names\n- **Assertions**: Clear, specific assertions\n\n### Package Management\n```bash\n\n# Add dependencies\nuv add <package> && uv lock && uv sync\n\n# Run commands\nuv run <command>\n\n# Development workflow\nuv run pytest tests/                    # Run tests\nuv run pytest tests/test_script.py     # Run specific tests\nuv run pytest -v                       # Verbose output\n```\n\n## Command Reference\n\n### Global Options\n- `--help`: Show help message\n- `--helpall`:

Environment Variables\nReplace hardcoded paths with configurable environment variables:\n```bash\ndocs_path = os.environ.get('SKOGAI_DOCS', '/home/skogix/SkogAI/docs/democracy/')\n```\n\n### 2. Migration\nMove dependencies into new structure and update references.\n\n### 3. Symlinks\nCreate symlinks from new location to maintain compatibility:\n```bash\nln -s /home/skogix/SkogAI/docs/democracy/ ./docs/democracy\n```\n\n### 4. Configuration Management\nUse configuration files instead of hardcoded paths.\n\n## Documentation Pattern\n\nFor each external dependency found:\n\n1. **Location** - Where the dependency is defined\n2. **Target** - What external path/resource it depends on\n3. **Impact** - What breaks if dependency is missing\n4. **Resolution** - How to address the dependency\n\nThis systematic approach ensures no dependencies are missed during system migrations or restructuring.","numLines":80,"startLine":1,"totalLines":80}}}

While SkogCLI has a working configuration system, this pattern needs to be extended systematically across the entire codebase.\n\n## Current State\n- Multiple components contain hardcoded paths (e.g., `/home/skogix/lore/agents/api/agent_api.py`)\n- SkogCLI uses a structured configuration system at `~/.config/skogcli/`\n- No standardized approach for path configuration across components\n\n## Proposed Solution\n1. Extend SkogCLI configuration pattern:\n   - User config in ~/.config/skogcli/\n   - Environment variable fallbacks\n   - Default configuration templates\n\n2. Create path resolution utilities:\n   - Standardized functions for common path patterns\n   - Configuration hierarchy enforcement\n   - Migration helpers for external tool dependencies\n\n3. Define implementation standards:\n   - No direct path string literals in code\n   - Required use of configuration system\n   - Documentation requirements for path usage\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Configuration system extended to cover all components\n- [ ] Existing hardcoded paths replaced with config-based resolution\n- [ ] Migration scripts created for automated path updates\n- [ ] Standards documented for future development\n- [ ] Pre-commit hooks or linting rules to prevent new hardcoded paths\nEOF\n)\"","description":"Create GitHub issue for path configuration","sandbox":true}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":850,"cache_read_input_tokens":33731,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":850,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":437,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CTVMTc5H1KNAaGKZf5FSW","type":"assistant","uuid":"4f15fbda-8588-4b4c-b6be-d8e0e073a4e8","timestamp":"2025-09-25T15:26:58.978Z"}
