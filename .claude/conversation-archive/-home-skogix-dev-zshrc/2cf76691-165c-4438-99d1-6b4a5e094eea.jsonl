Includes ALL_EXPORT for automatic parameter export, GLOBAL_EXPORT for controlling export behavior with builtins, GLOBAL_RCS for disabling system startup files, and RCS for controlling the sourcing of user startup files.\n\nSOURCE: https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Options\n\nLANGUAGE: APIDOC\nCODE:\n```\nALL_EXPORT (`-a`, ksh: `-a`)\n    All parameters subsequently defined are automatically exported.\n\nGLOBAL_EXPORT <Z>\n    If this option is set, passing the `-x` flag to the builtins `declare`, `float`, `integer`, `readonly` and `typeset` (but not `local`) will also set the `-g` flag; hence parameters exported to the environment will not be made local to the enclosing function, unless they were already or the flag `+g` is given explicitly. If the option is unset, exported parameters will be made local in just the same way as any other parameter. This option is set by default for backward compatibility; it is not recommended that its behaviour be relied upon. Note that the builtin `export` always sets both the `-x` and `-g` flags, and hence its effect extends beyond the scope of the enclosing function; this is the most portable way to achieve this behaviour.\n\nGLOBAL_RCS (`+d`) <D>\n    If this option is unset, the startup files `/etc/zprofile`, `/etc/zshrc`, `/etc/zlogin` and `/etc/zlogout` will not be run. It can be disabled and re-enabled at any time, including inside local startup files (`.zshrc`, etc.).\n\nRCS (`+f`) <D>\n    After `/etc/zshenv` is sourced on startup, source the `.zshenv`, `/etc/zprofile`, `.zprofile`, `/etc/zshrc`, `.zshrc`, `/etc/zlogin`, `.zlogin`, and `.zlogout` files, as described in [Files](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Files.html#Files). If this option is unset, the `/etc/zshenv` file is still sourced, but any of the others will not be; it can be set at any time to prevent the remaining startup files after the currently executing one from being sourced.\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Zsh Initialization and Startup Options\nDESCRIPTION: This section covers Zsh options related to shell initialization and startup files.

If you use the `HIST_EXPIRE_DUPS_FIRST` option, setting this value larger than the `SAVEHIST` size will give you the difference as a cushion for saving duplicated history events. If this is made local, it is not implicitly set to 0, but may be explicitly set locally.\n\nHOME <S>\n    The default argument for the `cd` command. This is not set automatically by the shell in `sh`, `ksh` or `csh` emulation, but it is typically present in the environment anyway, and if it becomes set it has its usual special behaviour.\n\nIFS <S>\n    Internal field separators (by default space, tab, newline and NUL), that are used to separate words which result from command or parameter expansion and words read by the `read` builtin. Any characters from the set space, tab and newline that appear in the IFS are called _IFS white space_. One or more IFS white space characters or one non-IFS white space character together with any adjacent IFS white space character delimit a field. If an IFS white space character appears twice consecutively in the IFS, this character is treated as if it were not an IFS white space character. If the parameter is unset, the default is used. Note this has a different effect from setting the parameter to an empty string.\n\nKEYBOARD_HACK\n    This variable defines a character to be removed from the end of the command line before interpreting it (interactive shells only). It is intended to fix the problem with keys placed annoyingly close to return and replaces the `SUNKEYBOARDHACK` option which did this for backquotes only. Should the chosen character be one of singlequote, doublequote or backquote, there must also be an odd number of them on the command line for the last one to be removed. For backward compatibility, if the `SUNKEYBOARDHACK` option is explicitly set, the value of `KEYBOARD_HACK` reverts to backquote. If the option is explicitly unset, this variable is set to empty.\n\nKEYTIMEOUT\n    The time the shell waits, in hundredths of seconds, for another key to be pressed when reading bound multi-character sequences.\n\nLANG <S>\n    This variable determines the locale category for any category not specifically selected via a variable starting with ‘`LC_`’.\n\nLC_ALL <S>\n    This variable overrides the value of the ‘`LANG`’ variable and the value of any of the other variables starting with ‘`LC_`’.\n\nLC_COLLATE <S>\n    This variable determines the locale category for character collation information within ranges in glob brackets and for sorting.\n\nLC_CTYPE <S>\n    This variable determines the locale category for character handling functions. If the `MULTIBYTE` option is in effect this variable or `LANG` should contain a value that reflects the character set in use, even if it is a single-byte character set, unless only the 7-bit subset (ASCII) is used. For example, if the character set is ISO-8859-1, a suitable value might be `en_US.iso88591` (certain Linux distributions) or `en_US.ISO8859-1` (MacOS).\n\nLC_MESSAGES <S>\n    This variable determines the language in which messages should be written. Note that zsh does not use message catalogs.\n\nLC_NUMERIC <S>\n    This variable affects the decimal point character and thousands separator character for the formatted input/output functions and string conversion functions. Note that zsh ignores this setting when parsing floating point mathematical expressions.\n\nLC_TIME <S>\n    This variable determines the locale category for date and time formatting in prompt escape sequences.\n\nLINES <S>\n    The number of lines for this terminal session. Used for printing select lists and for the line editor.\n\nLISTMAX\n    In the line editor, the number of matches to list without asking first. If the value is negative, the list will be shown if it spans at most as many lines as given by the absolute value. If set to zero, the shell asks only if the top of the listing would scroll off the screen.\n\nMAIL\n    \n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Startup Scripts in Compatibility Modes\nDESCRIPTION: Describes the startup script execution flow when Zsh is invoked in sh or ksh compatibility modes. It specifies which profile scripts are sourced and how the ENV environment variable is handled.\n\nSOURCE: https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Invocation\n\nLANGUAGE: zsh\nCODE:\n```\nThe usual zsh startup/shutdown scripts are not executed. Login shells source `/etc/profile` followed by `$HOME/.profile`. If the `ENV` environment variable is set on invocation, `$ENV` is sourced after the profile scripts. The value of `ENV` is subjected to parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion before being interpreted as a pathname. Note that the `PRIVILEGED` option also affects the execution of startup files.\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Zsh TYPESET_SILENT and TYPESET_TO_UNSET Options\nDESCRIPTION: Describes the `TYPESET_SILENT` and `TYPESET_TO_UNSET` options. `TYPESET_SILENT` controls whether `typeset` commands display existing parameter values by default. `TYPESET_TO_UNSET` ensures parameters declared with `typeset` remain unset until explicitly assigned a value.\n\nSOURCE: https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Options\n\nLANGUAGE: zsh\nCODE:\n```\n# Example usage of TYPESET_SILENT and TYPESET_TO_UNSET (not direct code snippets)\n# setopt typeset_silent: typeset var; echo $var (prints nothing by default)\n# setopt typeset_to_unset; typeset myvar; echo $myvar (prints nothing until myvar=value)\n\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Zsh Options for Expansion and Globbing\nDESCRIPTION: This section covers Zsh options that control parameter expansion and globbing behavior, such as RC_EXPAND_PARAM and RE_MATCH_PCRE.

These parameters allow users to customize the shell's functionality and appearance.\n\nSOURCE: https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Parameters\n\nLANGUAGE: APIDOC\nCODE:\n```\nMAILCHECK:\n    The interval in seconds between checks for new mail.\n\nmailpath <S> <Z> (MAILPATH <S>):\n    An array (colon-separated list) of filenames to check for new mail. Each filename can be followed by a ‘?‘ and a message that will be printed. The message will undergo parameter expansion, command substitution and arithmetic expansion with the variable $_ defined as the name of the file that has changed. The default message is ‘You have new mail‘. If an element is a directory instead of a file the shell will recursively check every file in every subdirectory of the element.\n\nmanpath <S> <Z> (MANPATH <S> <Z>):\n    An array (colon-separated list) whose value is not used by the shell. The manpath array can be useful, however, since setting it also sets MANPATH, and vice versa.\n\nmatch:\n    Arrays set by the shell when the b globbing flag is used in pattern matches.\n\nmbegin:\n    Arrays set by the shell when the b globbing flag is used in pattern matches.\n\nmend:\n    Arrays set by the shell when the b globbing flag is used in pattern matches.\n\nMATCH:\n    Set by the shell when the m globbing flag is used in pattern matches.\n\nMBEGIN:\n    Set by the shell when the m globbing flag is used in pattern matches.\n\nMEND:\n    Set by the shell when the m globbing flag is used in pattern matches.\n\nmodule_path <S> <Z> (MODULE_PATH <S>):\n    An array (colon-separated list) of directories that zmodload searches for dynamically loadable modules. This is initialized to a standard pathname, usually ‘/usr/local/lib/zsh/$ZSH_VERSION‘. (The ‘/usr/local/lib‘ part varies from installation to installation.) For security reasons, any value set in the environment when the shell is started will be ignored. These parameters only exist if the installation supports dynamic module loading.\n\nNULLCMD <S>:\n    The command name to assume if a redirection is specified with no command. Defaults to cat. For sh/ksh behavior, change this to :. For csh-like behavior, unset this parameter; the shell will print an error message if null commands are entered.\n\npath <S> <Z> (PATH <S>):\n    An array (colon-separated list) of directories to search for commands. When this parameter is set, each directory is scanned and all files found are put in a hash table.\n\nPOSTEDIT <S>:\n    This string is output whenever the line editor exits. It usually contains termcap strings to reset the terminal.\n\nPROMPT <S> <Z>:\n    Same as PS1.\n\nPROMPT2 <S> <Z>:\n    Same as PS2.\n\nPROMPT3 <S> <Z>:\n    Same as PS3.\n\nPROMPT4 <S> <Z>:\n    Same as PS4.\n\nprompt <S> <Z>:\n    Same as PS1.\n\nPROMPT_EOL_MARK:\n    When the PROMPT_CR and PROMPT_SP options are set, the PROMPT_EOL_MARK parameter can be used to customize how the end of partial lines are shown. This parameter undergoes prompt expansion, with the PROMPT_PERCENT option set. If not set, the default behavior is equivalent to the value ‘%B%S%#%s%b‘.\n\nPS1 <S>:\n    The primary prompt string, printed before a command is read. It undergoes a special form of expansion before being displayed; see Prompt Expansion. The default is ‘%m%# ‘.\n\nPS2 <S>:\n    The secondary prompt, printed when the shell needs more information to complete a command. It is expanded in the same way as PS1. The default is ‘%_> ‘, which displays any shell constructs or quotation marks which are currently being processed.\n\nPS3 <S>:\n    Selection prompt used within a select loop. It is expanded in the same way as PS1. The default is ‘?# ‘.\n\nPS4 <S>:\n    The execution trace prompt. Default is ‘+%N:%i> ‘, which displays the name of the current shell structure and the line number within it. In sh or ksh emulation, the default is ‘+ ‘.\n\npsvar <S> <Z> (PSVAR <S>):\n    An array (colon-separated list) whose elements can be used in PROMPT strings. Setting psvar also sets PSVAR, and vice versa.\n\nREADNULLCMD <S>:\n    The command name to assume if a single input redirection is specified with no command. Defaults to more.\n\nREPORTMEMORY:\n    If nonnegative, commands whose maximum resident set size (roughly speaking, main memory usage) in kilobytes is greater than this value have timing statistics reported. The format used to output statistics is the value of the TIMEFMT parameter, which is the same as for the REPORTTIME variable and the time builtin; note that by default this does not output memory usage. Appending \" max RSS %M\" to the value of TIMEFMT causes it to output the value that triggered the report. If REPORTTIME is also in use, at most a single report is printed for both triggers. This feature requires the getrusage() system call, commonly supported by modern Unix-like systems.\n\nREPORTTIME:\n    \n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Zsh Expansion and Globbing Options\nDESCRIPTION: Options that control how parameters are expanded and how filename globbing is performed.\n\nSOURCE: https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/zsh_10\n\nLANGUAGE: zsh\nCODE:\n```\n# NORCEXPANDPARAM: Do not expand parameters in rc files\n# NOREMATCHPCRE: Do not use PCRE for matching\n# NOSHGLOB: Do not use sh-compatible globbing\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Zsh Completion Options\nDESCRIPTION: Configuration options for Zsh's command-line completion system. These options control how completions are listed, selected, and displayed, affecting user experience and efficiency.\n\nSOURCE: https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Options\n\nLANGUAGE: APIDOC\nCODE:\n```\nALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT\n    If unset, key functions that list completions try to return to the last prompt if given a numeric argument. If set these functions try to return to the last prompt if given _no_ numeric argument.\n\nALWAYS_TO_END\n    If a completion is performed with the cursor within a word, and a full completion is inserted, the cursor is moved to the end of the word. That is, the cursor is moved to the end of the word if either a single match is inserted or menu completion is performed.\n\nAUTO_LIST (-9)\n    Automatically list choices on an ambiguous completion.\n\nAUTO_MENU\n    Automatically use menu completion after the second consecutive request for completion, for example by pressing the tab key repeatedly. This option is overridden by `MENU_COMPLETE`.\n\nAUTO_NAME_DIRS\n    Any parameter that is set to the absolute name of a directory immediately becomes a name for that directory, that will be used by the ‘`%~`’ and related prompt sequences, and will be available when completion is performed on a word starting with ‘`~`’. (Otherwise, the parameter must be used in the form ‘`~`param’ first.)\n\nAUTO_PARAM_KEYS\n    If a parameter name was completed and a following character (normally a space) automatically inserted, and the next character typed is one of those that have to come directly after the name (like ‘`}`’, ‘`:`’, etc.), the automatically added character is deleted, so that the character typed comes immediately after the parameter name. Completion in a brace expansion is affected similarly: the added character is a ‘`,`’, which will be removed if ‘`}`’ is typed next.\n\nAUTO_PARAM_SLASH\n    If a parameter is completed whose content is the name of a directory, then add a trailing slash instead of a space.\n\nAUTO_REMOVE_SLASH\n    When the last character resulting from a completion is a slash and the next character typed is a word delimiter, a slash, or a character that ends a command (such as a semicolon or an ampersand), remove the slash.\n\nBASH_AUTO_LIST\n    On an ambiguous completion, automatically list choices when the completion function is called twice in succession. This takes precedence over `AUTO_LIST`. The setting of `LIST_AMBIGUOUS` is respected. If `AUTO_MENU` is set, the menu behaviour will then start with the third press. Note that this will not work with `MENU_COMPLETE`, since repeated completion calls immediately cycle through the list in that case.\n\nCOMPLETE_ALIASES\n    Prevents aliases on the command line from being internally substituted before completion is attempted. The effect is to make the alias a distinct command for completion purposes.\n\nCOMPLETE_IN_WORD\n    If unset, the cursor is set to the end of the word if completion is started. Otherwise it stays there and completion is done from both ends.\n\nGLOB_COMPLETE\n    When the current word has a glob pattern, do not insert all the words resulting from the expansion but generate matches as for completion and cycle through them like `MENU_COMPLETE`. The matches are generated as if a ‘`*`’ was added to the end of the word, or inserted at the cursor when `COMPLETE_IN_WORD` is set. This actually uses pattern matching, not globbing, so it works not only for files but for any completion, such as options, user names, etc. Note that when the pattern matcher is used, matching control (for example, case-insensitive or anchored matching) cannot be used. This limitation only applies when the current word contains a pattern; simply turning on the `GLOB_COMPLETE` option does not have this effect.\n\nHASH_LIST_ALL\n    Whenever a command completion or spelling correction is attempted, make sure the entire command path is hashed first. This makes the first completion slower but avoids false reports of spelling errors.\n\nLIST_AMBIGUOUS\n    This option works when `AUTO_LIST` or `BASH_AUTO_LIST` is also set. If there is an unambiguous prefix to insert on the command line, that is done without a completion list being displayed; in other words, auto-listing behaviour only takes place when nothing would be inserted. In the case of `BASH_AUTO_LIST`, this means that the list will be delayed to the third call of the function.\n\nLIST_BEEP\n    Beep on an ambiguous completion. More accurately, this forces the completion widgets to return status 1 on an ambiguous completion, which causes the shell to beep if the option `BEEP` is also set; this may be modified if completion is called from a user-defined widget.\n\nLIST_PACKED\n    Try to make the completion list smaller (occupying less lines) by printing the matches in columns with different widths.\n\nLIST_ROWS_FIRST\n    Lay out the matches in completion lists sorted horizontally, that is, the second match is to the right of the first one, not under it as usual.\n\nLIST_TYPES (-X)\n    \n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Zsh History Configuration Options\nDESCRIPTION: Details various Zsh options for configuring history behavior, including appending to a file, handling duplicates, enabling substitution, and timestamping.\n\nSOURCE: https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/zsh_2\n\nLANGUAGE: zsh\nCODE:\n```\n# Example Zsh options related to history:\n# setopt append_history  # Append history to file instead of overwriting\n# setopt hist_ignore_dups # Ignore duplicate commands\n# setopt hist_verify      # Show command before executing after history expansion\n# setopt timestamping     # Add timestamps to history entries\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Zsh Parameter Usage\nDESCRIPTION: Documentation on how specific parameters are utilized within the Zsh shell, such as the AUTO_PUSHD option.\n\nSOURCE: https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Options-Index\n\nLANGUAGE: APIDOC\nCODE:\n```\nAUTO_PUSHD, use of:\n  - Description: Controls the behavior of the AUTO_PUSHD option, which affects directory stacking.\n  - Related Options: AUTO_PUSHD, AUTO_CD\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Zmodload Parameter Management\nDESCRIPTION: Manages autoloaded parameters.

Includes ALL_EXPORT for automatic parameter export, GLOBAL_EXPORT for controlling export behavior with builtins, GLOBAL_RCS for disabling system startup files, and RCS for controlling the sourcing of user startup files.\n\nSOURCE: https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Options\n\nLANGUAGE: APIDOC\nCODE:\n```\nALL_EXPORT (`-a`, ksh: `-a`)\n    All parameters subsequently defined are automatically exported.\n\nGLOBAL_EXPORT <Z>\n    If this option is set, passing the `-x` flag to the builtins `declare`, `float`, `integer`, `readonly` and `typeset` (but not `local`) will also set the `-g` flag; hence parameters exported to the environment will not be made local to the enclosing function, unless they were already or the flag `+g` is given explicitly. If the option is unset, exported parameters will be made local in just the same way as any other parameter. This option is set by default for backward compatibility; it is not recommended that its behaviour be relied upon. Note that the builtin `export` always sets both the `-x` and `-g` flags, and hence its effect extends beyond the scope of the enclosing function; this is the most portable way to achieve this behaviour.\n\nGLOBAL_RCS (`+d`) <D>\n    If this option is unset, the startup files `/etc/zprofile`, `/etc/zshrc`, `/etc/zlogin` and `/etc/zlogout` will not be run. It can be disabled and re-enabled at any time, including inside local startup files (`.zshrc`, etc.).\n\nRCS (`+f`) <D>\n    After `/etc/zshenv` is sourced on startup, source the `.zshenv`, `/etc/zprofile`, `.zprofile`, `/etc/zshrc`, `.zshrc`, `/etc/zlogin`, `.zlogin`, and `.zlogout` files, as described in [Files](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Files.html#Files).

If you use the `HIST_EXPIRE_DUPS_FIRST` option, setting this value larger than the `SAVEHIST` size will give you the difference as a cushion for saving duplicated history events. If this is made local, it is not implicitly set to 0, but may be explicitly set locally.\n\nHOME <S>\n    The default argument for the `cd` command. This is not set automatically by the shell in `sh`, `ksh` or `csh` emulation, but it is typically present in the environment anyway, and if it becomes set it has its usual special behaviour.\n\nIFS <S>\n    Internal field separators (by default space, tab, newline and NUL), that are used to separate words which result from command or parameter expansion and words read by the `read` builtin. Any characters from the set space, tab and newline that appear in the IFS are called _IFS white space_. One or more IFS white space characters or one non-IFS white space character together with any adjacent IFS white space character delimit a field. If an IFS white space character appears twice consecutively in the IFS, this character is treated as if it were not an IFS white space character. If the parameter is unset, the default is used. Note this has a different effect from setting the parameter to an empty string.\n\nKEYBOARD_HACK\n    This variable defines a character to be removed from the end of the command line before interpreting it (interactive shells only). It is intended to fix the problem with keys placed annoyingly close to return and replaces the `SUNKEYBOARDHACK` option which did this for backquotes only. Should the chosen character be one of singlequote, doublequote or backquote, there must also be an odd number of them on the command line for the last one to be removed. For backward compatibility, if the `SUNKEYBOARDHACK` option is explicitly set, the value of `KEYBOARD_HACK` reverts to backquote. If the option is explicitly unset, this variable is set to empty.\n\nKEYTIMEOUT\n    The time the shell waits, in hundredths of seconds, for another key to be pressed when reading bound multi-character sequences.\n\nLANG <S>\n    This variable determines the locale category for any category not specifically selected via a variable starting with ‘`LC_`’.\n\nLC_ALL <S>\n    This variable overrides the value of the ‘`LANG`’ variable and the value of any of the other variables starting with ‘`LC_`’.\n\nLC_COLLATE <S>\n    This variable determines the locale category for character collation information within ranges in glob brackets and for sorting.\n\nLC_CTYPE <S>\n    This variable determines the locale category for character handling functions. If the `MULTIBYTE` option is in effect this variable or `LANG` should contain a value that reflects the character set in use, even if it is a single-byte character set, unless only the 7-bit subset (ASCII) is used. For example, if the character set is ISO-8859-1, a suitable value might be `en_US.iso88591` (certain Linux distributions) or `en_US.ISO8859-1` (MacOS).\n\nLC_MESSAGES <S>\n    This variable determines the language in which messages should be written. Note that zsh does not use message catalogs.\n\nLC_NUMERIC <S>\n    This variable affects the decimal point character and thousands separator character for the formatted input/output functions and string conversion functions. Note that zsh ignores this setting when parsing floating point mathematical expressions.\n\nLC_TIME <S>\n    This variable determines the locale category for date and time formatting in prompt escape sequences.\n\nLINES <S>\n    The number of lines for this terminal session. Used for printing select lists and for the line editor.\n\nLISTMAX\n    In the line editor, the number of matches to list without asking first. If the value is negative, the list will be shown if it spans at most as many lines as given by the absolute value. If set to zero, the shell asks only if the top of the listing would scroll off the screen.\n\nMAIL\n    \n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Startup Scripts in Compatibility Modes\nDESCRIPTION: Describes the startup script execution flow when Zsh is invoked in sh or ksh compatibility modes. It specifies which profile scripts are sourced and how the ENV environment variable is handled.\n\nSOURCE: https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Invocation\n\nLANGUAGE: zsh\nCODE:\n```\nThe usual zsh startup/shutdown scripts are not executed. Login shells source `/etc/profile` followed by `$HOME/.profile`. If the `ENV` environment variable is set on invocation, `$ENV` is sourced after the profile scripts. The value of `ENV` is subjected to parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion before being interpreted as a pathname. Note that the `PRIVILEGED` option also affects the execution of startup files.\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Zsh TYPESET_SILENT and TYPESET_TO_UNSET Options\nDESCRIPTION: Describes the `TYPESET_SILENT` and `TYPESET_TO_UNSET` options. `TYPESET_SILENT` controls whether `typeset` commands display existing parameter values by default. `TYPESET_TO_UNSET` ensures parameters declared with `typeset` remain unset until explicitly assigned a value.\n\nSOURCE: https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Options\n\nLANGUAGE: zsh\nCODE:\n```\n# Example usage of TYPESET_SILENT and TYPESET_TO_UNSET (not direct code snippets)\n# setopt typeset_silent: typeset var; echo $var (prints nothing by default)\n# setopt typeset_to_unset; typeset myvar; echo $myvar (prints nothing until myvar=value)\n\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Zsh Options for Expansion and Globbing\nDESCRIPTION: This section covers Zsh options that control parameter expansion and globbing behavior, such as RC_EXPAND_PARAM and RE_MATCH_PCRE.

Without this option, unset parameters are treated as an error.\n\nSOURCE: https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Options\n\nLANGUAGE: APIDOC\nCODE:\n```\nUNSET (+u, ksh: +u):\n  Treats unset parameters as empty during substitution.\n  Treats unset parameters as zero in arithmetic expansion and commands.\n  Otherwise, unset parameters are an error.\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Non-Special Parameters in Compatibility Modes\nDESCRIPTION: Lists parameters that are not considered special and are not initialized by Zsh when it is operating in sh or ksh compatibility modes. These parameters retain their default or user-defined values.\n\nSOURCE: https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Invocation\n\nLANGUAGE: zsh\nCODE:\n```\nIn sh and ksh compatibility modes the following parameters are not special and not initialized by the shell: `ARGC`, `argv`, `cdpath`, `fignore`, `fpath`, `HISTCHARS`, `mailpath`, `MANPATH`, `manpath`, `path`, `prompt`, `PROMPT`, `PROMPT2`, `PROMPT3`, `PROMPT4`, `psvar`, `status`.\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Optimizing /etc/zshenv\nDESCRIPTION: Provides a recommendation for keeping the /etc/zshenv file minimal and using conditional tests to avoid unnecessary execution, especially when zsh is invoked with the '-f' option.\n\nSOURCE: https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Files\n\nLANGUAGE: zsh\nCODE:\n```\n# It is a good idea to put code that does not need to be run for every single shell\n# behind a test of the form ‘if [[ -o rcs ]]; then ...’\n\nif [[ -o rcs ]]; then\n  # Place code here that should only run when RCS is enabled\n  # For example, setting environment variables or running specific commands\n  export MY_VARIABLE=\"some_value\"\nelse\n  # Code that should run regardless of RCS, or code to be skipped when RCS is off\n  echo \"RCS is not enabled, skipping some configurations.\"\nfi\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Zsh Options: NO_FUNCTION_ARGZERO\nDESCRIPTION: The NO_FUNCTION_ARGZERO option controls how positional parameters are handled in functions when no arguments are provided.

These parameters allow users to customize the shell's functionality and appearance.\n\nSOURCE: https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Parameters\n\nLANGUAGE: APIDOC\nCODE:\n```\nMAILCHECK:\n    The interval in seconds between checks for new mail.\n\nmailpath <S> <Z> (MAILPATH <S>):\n    An array (colon-separated list) of filenames to check for new mail. Each filename can be followed by a ‘?‘ and a message that will be printed. The message will undergo parameter expansion, command substitution and arithmetic expansion with the variable $_ defined as the name of the file that has changed. The default message is ‘You have new mail‘. If an element is a directory instead of a file the shell will recursively check every file in every subdirectory of the element.\n\nmanpath <S> <Z> (MANPATH <S> <Z>):\n    An array (colon-separated list) whose value is not used by the shell. The manpath array can be useful, however, since setting it also sets MANPATH, and vice versa.\n\nmatch:\n    Arrays set by the shell when the b globbing flag is used in pattern matches.\n\nmbegin:\n    Arrays set by the shell when the b globbing flag is used in pattern matches.\n\nmend:\n    Arrays set by the shell when the b globbing flag is used in pattern matches.\n\nMATCH:\n    Set by the shell when the m globbing flag is used in pattern matches.\n\nMBEGIN:\n    Set by the shell when the m globbing flag is used in pattern matches.\n\nMEND:\n    Set by the shell when the m globbing flag is used in pattern matches.\n\nmodule_path <S> <Z> (MODULE_PATH <S>):\n    An array (colon-separated list) of directories that zmodload searches for dynamically loadable modules. This is initialized to a standard pathname, usually ‘/usr/local/lib/zsh/$ZSH_VERSION‘. (The ‘/usr/local/lib‘ part varies from installation to installation.) For security reasons, any value set in the environment when the shell is started will be ignored. These parameters only exist if the installation supports dynamic module loading.\n\nNULLCMD <S>:\n    The command name to assume if a redirection is specified with no command. Defaults to cat. For sh/ksh behavior, change this to :. For csh-like behavior, unset this parameter; the shell will print an error message if null commands are entered.\n\npath <S> <Z> (PATH <S>):\n    An array (colon-separated list) of directories to search for commands. When this parameter is set, each directory is scanned and all files found are put in a hash table.\n\nPOSTEDIT <S>:\n    This string is output whenever the line editor exits. It usually contains termcap strings to reset the terminal.\n\nPROMPT <S> <Z>:\n    Same as PS1.\n\nPROMPT2 <S> <Z>:\n    Same as PS2.\n\nPROMPT3 <S> <Z>:\n    Same as PS3.\n\nPROMPT4 <S> <Z>:\n    Same as PS4.\n\nprompt <S> <Z>:\n    Same as PS1.\n\nPROMPT_EOL_MARK:\n    When the PROMPT_CR and PROMPT_SP options are set, the PROMPT_EOL_MARK parameter can be used to customize how the end of partial lines are shown. This parameter undergoes prompt expansion, with the PROMPT_PERCENT option set. If not set, the default behavior is equivalent to the value ‘%B%S%#%s%b‘.\n\nPS1 <S>:\n    The primary prompt string, printed before a command is read. It undergoes a special form of expansion before being displayed; see Prompt Expansion. The default is ‘%m%# ‘.\n\nPS2 <S>:\n    The secondary prompt, printed when the shell needs more information to complete a command. It is expanded in the same way as PS1. The default is ‘%_> ‘, which displays any shell constructs or quotation marks which are currently being processed.\n\nPS3 <S>:\n    Selection prompt used within a select loop. It is expanded in the same way as PS1. The default is ‘?# ‘.\n\nPS4 <S>:\n    The execution trace prompt. Default is ‘+%N:%i> ‘, which displays the name of the current shell structure and the line number within it. In sh or ksh emulation, the default is ‘+ ‘.\n\npsvar <S> <Z> (PSVAR <S>):\n    An array (colon-separated list) whose elements can be used in PROMPT strings. Setting psvar also sets PSVAR, and vice versa.\n\nREADNULLCMD <S>:\n    The command name to assume if a single input redirection is specified with no command. Defaults to more.\n\nREPORTMEMORY:\n    If nonnegative, commands whose maximum resident set size (roughly speaking, main memory usage) in kilobytes is greater than this value have timing statistics reported. The format used to output statistics is the value of the TIMEFMT parameter, which is the same as for the REPORTTIME variable and the time builtin; note that by default this does not output memory usage. Appending \" max RSS %M\" to the value of TIMEFMT causes it to output the value that triggered the report. If REPORTTIME is also in use, at most a single report is printed for both triggers. This feature requires the getrusage() system call, commonly supported by modern Unix-like systems.\n\nREPORTTIME:\n    \n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Zsh Expansion and Globbing Options\nDESCRIPTION: Options that control how parameters are expanded and how filename globbing is performed.\n\nSOURCE: https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/zsh_10\n\nLANGUAGE: zsh\nCODE:\n```\n# NORCEXPANDPARAM: Do not expand parameters in rc files\n# NOREMATCHPCRE: Do not use PCRE for matching\n# NOSHGLOB: Do not use sh-compatible globbing\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Zsh Completion Options\nDESCRIPTION: Configuration options for Zsh's command-line completion system. These options control how completions are listed, selected, and displayed, affecting user experience and efficiency.\n\nSOURCE: https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Options\n\nLANGUAGE: APIDOC\nCODE:\n```\nALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT\n    If unset, key functions that list completions try to return to the last prompt if given a numeric argument. If set these functions try to return to the last prompt if given _no_ numeric argument.\n\nALWAYS_TO_END\n    If a completion is performed with the cursor within a word, and a full completion is inserted, the cursor is moved to the end of the word. That is, the cursor is moved to the end of the word if either a single match is inserted or menu completion is performed.\n\nAUTO_LIST (-9)\n    Automatically list choices on an ambiguous completion.\n\nAUTO_MENU\n    Automatically use menu completion after the second consecutive request for completion, for example by pressing the tab key repeatedly. This option is overridden by `MENU_COMPLETE`.\n\nAUTO_NAME_DIRS\n    Any parameter that is set to the absolute name of a directory immediately becomes a name for that directory, that will be used by the ‘`%~`’ and related prompt sequences, and will be available when completion is performed on a word starting with ‘`~`’. (Otherwise, the parameter must be used in the form ‘`~`param’ first.)\n\nAUTO_PARAM_KEYS\n    If a parameter name was completed and a following character (normally a space) automatically inserted, and the next character typed is one of those that have to come directly after the name (like ‘`}`’, ‘`:`’, etc.), the automatically added character is deleted, so that the character typed comes immediately after the parameter name. Completion in a brace expansion is affected similarly: the added character is a ‘`,`’, which will be removed if ‘`}`’ is typed next.\n\nAUTO_PARAM_SLASH\n    If a parameter is completed whose content is the name of a directory, then add a trailing slash instead of a space.\n\nAUTO_REMOVE_SLASH\n    When the last character resulting from a completion is a slash and the next character typed is a word delimiter, a slash, or a character that ends a command (such as a semicolon or an ampersand), remove the slash.\n\nBASH_AUTO_LIST\n    On an ambiguous completion, automatically list choices when the completion function is called twice in succession. This takes precedence over `AUTO_LIST`. The setting of `LIST_AMBIGUOUS` is respected. If `AUTO_MENU` is set, the menu behaviour will then start with the third press. Note that this will not work with `MENU_COMPLETE`, since repeated completion calls immediately cycle through the list in that case.\n\nCOMPLETE_ALIASES\n    Prevents aliases on the command line from being internally substituted before completion is attempted. The effect is to make the alias a distinct command for completion purposes.\n\nCOMPLETE_IN_WORD\n    If unset, the cursor is set to the end of the word if completion is started. Otherwise it stays there and completion is done from both ends.\n\nGLOB_COMPLETE\n    When the current word has a glob pattern, do not insert all the words resulting from the expansion but generate matches as for completion and cycle through them like `MENU_COMPLETE`. The matches are generated as if a ‘`*`’ was added to the end of the word, or inserted at the cursor when `COMPLETE_IN_WORD` is set. This actually uses pattern matching, not globbing, so it works not only for files but for any completion, such as options, user names, etc. Note that when the pattern matcher is used, matching control (for example, case-insensitive or anchored matching) cannot be used. This limitation only applies when the current word contains a pattern; simply turning on the `GLOB_COMPLETE` option does not have this effect.\n\nHASH_LIST_ALL\n    Whenever a command completion or spelling correction is attempted, make sure the entire command path is hashed first. This makes the first completion slower but avoids false reports of spelling errors.\n\nLIST_AMBIGUOUS\n    This option works when `AUTO_LIST` or `BASH_AUTO_LIST` is also set. If there is an unambiguous prefix to insert on the command line, that is done without a completion list being displayed; in other words, auto-listing behaviour only takes place when nothing would be inserted. In the case of `BASH_AUTO_LIST`, this means that the list will be delayed to the third call of the function.\n\nLIST_BEEP\n    Beep on an ambiguous completion. More accurately, this forces the completion widgets to return status 1 on an ambiguous completion, which causes the shell to beep if the option `BEEP` is also set; this may be modified if completion is called from a user-defined widget.\n\nLIST_PACKED\n    Try to make the completion list smaller (occupying less lines) by printing the matches in columns with different widths.\n\nLIST_ROWS_FIRST\n    Lay out the matches in completion lists sorted horizontally, that is, the second match is to the right of the first one, not under it as usual.\n\nLIST_TYPES (-X)\n    \n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Zsh History Configuration Options\nDESCRIPTION: Details various Zsh options for configuring history behavior, including appending to a file, handling duplicates, enabling substitution, and timestamping.\n\nSOURCE: https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/zsh_2\n\nLANGUAGE: zsh\nCODE:\n```\n# Example Zsh options related to history:\n# setopt append_history  # Append history to file instead of overwriting\n# setopt hist_ignore_dups # Ignore duplicate commands\n# setopt hist_verify      # Show command before executing after history expansion\n# setopt timestamping     # Add timestamps to history entries\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Zsh Parameter Usage\nDESCRIPTION: Documentation on how specific parameters are utilized within the Zsh shell, such as the AUTO_PUSHD option.\n\nSOURCE: https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Options-Index\n\nLANGUAGE: APIDOC\nCODE:\n```\nAUTO_PUSHD, use of:\n  - Description: Controls the behavior of the AUTO_PUSHD option, which affects directory stacking.\n  - Related Options: AUTO_PUSHD, AUTO_CD\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Zmodload Parameter Management\nDESCRIPTION: Manages autoloaded parameters.

I've created a clean, modular zsh configuration system that you can test independently from your current setup.

You can:\n- Test commands and see the clean prompt\n- Check history is working (`h` command for searching)\n- Verify completions work\n- Exit anytime to return to your old config\n\n## Next Modules to Add\n\nWe can incrementally add modules to `conf.d/`:\n- Git prompt integration\n- Fuzzy finding\n- Directory jumping  \n- Syntax highlighting (pure zsh implementation)\n- Project-specific environments\n\nThe beauty is you can build exactly what you need, understand every line, and keep it fast!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":529,"cache_read_input_tokens":45096,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":529,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":359,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CTcpjtFEWM8J8gEZTWc3K","uuid":"07ae38ea-b02a-4b15-94ed-f624b3cafdc5"}

Let me walk you through the key parts:\n\n## The Launcher Script\nJust bash detection logic for different terminals - nothing zsh-specific.\n\n## `.zshenv` - The Foundation\n```bash\n: ${ZDOTDIR:=$HOME/.config/zsh}  # Parameter expansion: set if unset\n```\nThis uses parameter expansion to set ZDOTDIR only if it's not already set. The `:` is a no-op command that evaluates its arguments.\n\n## `.zshrc` - Core Concepts\n\n**Compilation Cache:**\n```bash\ntypeset -i updated_at=$(date +'%j' -r \"$XDG_CACHE_HOME/zsh/zcompdump\" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)\n```\n- `typeset -i` declares an integer variable\n- We check if completions were updated today (day of year)\n- `compinit -C` skips security checks if cache is fresh (faster startup)\n\n**Glob Qualifiers:**\n```bash\nfor config_file in \"$ZDOTDIR\"/conf.d/*.zsh(N); do\n```\nThe `(N)` is a glob qualifier - `NULL_GLOB` for this pattern only. If no files match, the loop gets nothing instead of an error.\n\n**Options Worth Knowing:**\n- `setopt PROMPT_SUBST` - Enables `$()` and `${}` expansion in prompts\n- `setopt EXTENDED_GLOB` - Powers like `**/*.txt` (recursive) and `^pattern` (negation)\n- `setopt SHARE_HISTORY` - Real-time history sharing between sessions\n\n## `history.zsh` - ZLE Widgets\n\n```bash\nautoload -U up-line-or-beginning-search\nzle -N up-line-or-beginning-search\nbindkey \"^[[A\" up-line-or-beginning-search\n```\nThis three-step dance:\n1. `autoload -U` - Load function from `$fpath` (-U = don't expand aliases)\n2. `zle -N` - Register as a ZLE (line editor) widget\n3. `bindkey` - Bind to a key sequence\n\n---\n\nNothing too exotic yet! The real zsh power comes when we add:\n- Parameter expansion tricks\n- Associative arrays\n- Hook functions\n- Custom completions\n- Advanced prompt themes\n\nWant to explore any of these areas next, or should we build out more basics first?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":212,"cache_read_input_tokens":47069,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":212,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":589,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CTcqCE6Z4PsF2SmgBce3D","uuid":"7a64e34b-c629-4573-83da-9865f3ec851d"}

But wait, if I'm in `/home/user` and run `/some/other/path/launch.sh`, then `dirname $0` would be `/some/other/path`. So the config would be at `/some/other/path/config`. But why would you want your zsh config tied to where the launcher script lives? That's insane.\n\n2. The `-d /foo/bar` point - if you specify a working directory when launching kitty, my script assumes `$PWD` which would be wrong. It would use the current shell's PWD, not the new terminal's starting directory.\n\n3. \"if tmux then\" - I'm detecting if we're IN tmux and then... creating a new tmux window? That's not spawning a new terminal at all, that's just making a new tmux window inside the existing terminal. Completely different thing.\n\n4. The whole approach is backwards - I'm trying to detect what terminal to launch FROM INSIDE a terminal, when the user clearly knows how they want to launch their terminal.\n\n5. `exec zsh` without passing the environment - yeah that's broken\n\n6. Using bash/zsh to launch zsh - why not just set the env vars where you need them?\n\n7. The script assumes it knows better than the user about how they want to launch their terminal\n\nThis is really bad. I'm writing \"smart\" scripts that don't understand basic UNIX concepts like:\n- Environment inheritance\n- Working directories  \n- The difference between a terminal emulator and a shell\n- The difference between a tmux window and a new terminal\n\nThe user's one-liner is correct because:\n- It sets ZDOTDIR in the environment that kitty will inherit\n- It launches kitty with --detach (new instance)\n- It specifies zsh as the command to run\n- It's explicit about what it's doing\n\n\nMy script is trying to be \"helpful\" by detecting terminals but doesn't even understand the basic model of how terminals and shells work.\n\nI'm creating an overly complex solution that completely misses the fundamental principles of terminal and shell interactions. My attempts at being clever are actually introducing more complexity and potential errors. The script demonstrates a profound misunderstanding of how environment, process launching, and terminal emulators actually function in a UNIX-like system.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":8,"cache_creation_input_tokens":49321,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":49321,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CTcrxGay2BDdaZFKgDUsE","uuid":"aee53430-6425-4915-b873-a023e700f3ab"}

ZDOTDIR changes where zsh looks for its config files (.zshenv, .zshrc, etc.)\n2.

But I shouldn't assume what that means.\n\nA better approach: Ask the question, explain why it matters for the config, but DON'T guess at the answer.","signature":"EsQHCkYICBgCKkC9fS+xk+uJ9msvtGaf7Hcna0NXzQvzrGKqIIxXtuGCYyxlfYjuYeacipqEo1hvn9eQsJauzotkSgHjcsYTkFoiEgzyKviVLdvMFT6KhGoaDB64HJS6bVf7y8NElCIwIeIMOAfx4LE6I7UTW/HpKYxlkhjJ9ekTurNKDjXPT1UXsds+LhjlRZrsRAhxAIKvKqsGfS9WiTCTxU3MQsLxsfBo+Bg3dbJK2PjA1q33UsgnEseafL0Pc3tyFOCKZTMXQRxS7Ftaf72mIQFEIwjE1n3v7UELMfzns/Wj/+X/ktL/99UIg8yOcfKnOeXDP4pOG3/bfAfrX81Xbc7cxT7fKA7ASXHSW1+ai5LVDUm8ANgu7x1VyZqdaxG+HgeDVapUBvVZ6ZedWURb9dn+iITpEaZ7iKxf2/+eAjDVya072Oh00JJoBHc241qylH6i4aTKS04hI3/cZhwL6lLbZ1YXKW0ZdUJ7tpYB4SkLzImZqDf8JhZzqUWBGPAybUFKeUV+x+0NCkq+ZpgJ/vG+1RE10JLg8Bl1Spg2OK7aBAVDhrnpf7G2n66jfFtVnMYX5m65Kf9JB6zlE4EOvLNV06gNCbYG9QGXx6B806KQiY04cpvBlqH9Cd8LAWA7t1/L4OBBLtzLHGHoMooAIHSY7aIuZ8GtluY6ReDmsJXQkxctGLs7XITY9VlEnefgqdanXHtOeiny6tdvSgRQYZAGxu9qpQOzXvC9E09pbRCeWYPvPdwiZznMEpy4gGKJfK6idLjOvzQ4/dBwd+HKdssVagxExwfId6dZSAlc74D02mjIVUunFhCGkuqiVfzftiJ0RFx8+V6+AjBpLloLA+aIsnj6YyILlG130m5KMahwmXoBwe8PTq1pnLFlQXL1yNkiVEaZoVsBWOAGRKRnHGgCip0AE2j6vSMOBAU1dXJtlQIZqzV1ImbAZLzEUhdVF2qEoWwkAdKvzi+TxaIlIASSkjiDSdk08pAYWfFeVbsI6lGEiwCOPPSsNXd1HwT8a126OTtTKv4rWg5bDRzJNIG891Kr+df7JmPNU2jCq4NU60aPtpZHXf5HgyGX3V7f8WYF+pnurmYas4EpifrUiPekknOKlAJVwWdm2Vr/mfLRMUog3tvPWrBUueR+r5bXFlWArPWqM7SK+SAq4ocgcFED/Dwz/+N5MHcEj9pB1fdShomlMa2mEQXGIK/p0DrAz3K6/dIaAR+kBdwmuLDnHPhuQ2nh16982csDmfiYhwSPNhG/daiQmg+sVmToxT2QVFgyvxgB"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":9,"cache_creation_input_tokens":37994,"cache_read_input_tokens":16576,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":37994,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":4,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CTcxtaBy9cfGvfQyPaoBd","type":"assistant","uuid":"ffd035e0-ba75-4080-be73-2207972b936d","timestamp":"2025-09-29T15:55:45.667Z"}
