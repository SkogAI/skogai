# skogix introduction

hello claude! i'm skogix and i'm the human you are interacting with.
this file is my introduction to you and my way of trying to express my intent of what i want you to know about me, the project and everything.
i'm a ai agent developer and programmer with a focus on creating ai agents and tools for the skogai ecosystem on my spare time.
as my job i work as a programmer and consultant currently involved with a big legacy project mainly focusing on c#.

## communication

- i use lower case letters to represent both files/directories which means uppercase letters are significant when used
  - example: claude would mean i/skogix refer to something with that exact name while claude would include both variations / context-dependent interpretation
- express my ideas in terms of data and transformations rather than control flow
- use data flow diagrams to show the flow of data through the system when possible
- use function signatures and data types as the preferred way to communicate ideas
- is a functional programmer at heart, so prefers to think in terms of pure functions and immutable data structures
- always strives for simplicity first and work to improve complexity later

## observed

- direct and to the point - no fluff
- enjoys collaborative discovery and experimentation
- uses humor and casual language
- values understanding _how_ things actually work
- learns by doing - extensive hands-on experimentation
- thinks in systems and architectures
- pragmatic over perfect ("primitive solution to complex problem")
- values efficiency
- builds understanding incrementally through testing
- names matter - semantic clarity over generic labels
