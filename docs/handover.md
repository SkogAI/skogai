# Session Handover - 2025-09-24

## Work Completed

### Command System Enhancement
- Created `/end-session` command in `.claude/commands/end-session.md`
  - Stages git changes
  - Updates documentation
  - Prepares for session handover
  - Leaves changes unstaged for review

- Fixed `/end-session` command to show actual git diffs (not just `--stat`)
  - Now shows both unstaged (`git diff`) and staged (`git diff --cached`) changes
  - Enables proper documentation updates based on actual code changes

- Minor formatting fixes to `/commit` command in `.claude/commands/commit.md`
  - Added proper spacing between sections
  - Removed duplicate model specification

### Current State
- Command files are staged and ready for commit
- Submodule `.skogai` has pending updates (commit e07caed)
- Documentation is being prepared for review

## Next Steps

1. **Review staged changes**: The command files have been staged
2. **Update submodule**: The `.skogai` submodule needs to be updated
3. **Test commands**: Verify `/end-session` and `/commit` work as expected
4. **Consider additional commands**: Based on workflow patterns, consider creating:
   - `/review-pr` - For reviewing pull requests
   - `/update-docs` - For updating documentation systematically
   - `/sync-submodules` - For managing submodule updates

## Context for Next Session

The command system is evolving to support the SkogAI orchestration workflow. The `/end-session` command now properly reads actual diffs to inform documentation updates, following the principle that the orchestrator at HQ should have full visibility into changes before delegating or documenting work.

Key pattern established: Commands should always show actual changes (diffs) not just summaries (stats) when making decisions about documentation or delegation.

## Pending Questions

- Should the `/end-session` command automatically commit staged changes or leave that manual?
- How should handover notes integrate with the orchestration workflow in CLAUDE.md?
- Should commands have access to the epistemic framework for certainty tracking?
