description: A simple hello world command demonstrating slash commands in Claude plugins

# Hello World Command

this is a demonstration of a slash command in a claude plugin.

when this command is invoked, respond with:

```
hello world from the command component!

this demonstrates:
- slash commands are markdown files in commands/
- they get triggered with /command-name
- the content provides instructions to claude
- commands appear in /help when plugin is installed
```

be friendly and explain that this is a working example of the command component type.
